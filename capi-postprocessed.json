The point I made was we certainly wouldn’t be putting on a request to operate any additional facility because we don’t have the capacity, we are at capacity now. </p> <p>As the prime minister said, down the track, quarantine could look different once the majority of our population is vaccinated and international borders are open.

We welcome the Federal Government’s allocations announced yesterday. Particularly when it comes to doubling the supply for the next few weeks. Of AstraZeneca for our GPs. That is most welcome. We have in fact been eating into our supplies. And having demonstrated that, I was pleased with the Commonwealth, providing Victoria extra doses beyond our allocated standard numbers. Health minister Martin Foley has given further context to the 11 cases reported today, which include three children and an adult, another staff member at the Arcare aged care facility (in addition to the resident and staff member reported yesterday, but included in today’s numbers) and four household contacts to the Whittlesea outbreak. The final numbers include a new case in Port Melbourne: a construction worker who has been previously identified. The Victorian press conference has begun. There is no clash between ABC management and Four Corners over the QAnon story, Senate estimates has been told. An upcoming episode examining the relationship between the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory was delayed for review last week. ABC managing director David Anderson said he respected Four Corners and stood by its journalism, despite his decision as editor-in-chief to delay the QAnon story. He said: I do have absolute faith and the utmost respect for the 4C team... it is not unreasonable for me to question certain things. News Corp reported on Monday that Four Corners was at war with management. Anderson said no one in government or the Liberal party had contacted the ABC and demanded the story not be aired and that the ABC board had not been consulted over the issue. However, he confirmed that an adviser for Morrison had contacted ABC news chief Gaven Morris about the story. Anderson said: I do not believe there has been an intervention by the government or anyone else that the program should not go to air. We are on standby for the Victorian press conference, thankfully no crossover today, but I wonder if we’ll hear any reaction to Scott Morrison essentially putting some pressure on the state government to lift lockdown “as soon as possible”. Finally, the PM was also asked his thoughts on the Queensland premier getting the Pfizer jab so she could go to the Olympics. He says: I have no plans to go to those Olympics. I’ll be looking forward to seeing the Japanese prime minister next weekend – this weekend coming, I should say – at the G7. Can you imagine having gone through all those preparations and then having the world struck by a pandemic? That I know was quite heartbreaking for the people of Japan and so we wish them all the best as they persevere and put these Games on. Next up, Morrison was asked if the lockdown in Victoria should be extended. He says: That would ultimately be a decision for the Victorian government, as it always is. The commonwealth will determine its position through the chief medical officer. We are seeing the cases that are identified, occurring in quarantining, and whether they are presenting in other areas, a contained situation. Here in Australia, we are living in a way with this virus like few if any other countries other than New Zealand are in the world. And this is a challenging lockdown but it’s one that will be overcome and it will be one that I hope will see Victoria opened again soon, particularly for those parents who are having to keep the kids at home away from school. Kids have lost enough time out of school over the course of the last 18 months. It’s very important we get those kids to school as soon as possible. I am hopeful that these restrictions in Victoria will be lifted as soon as possible. As the premier herself said when similar circumstances were faced here, in New South Wales, the restrictions were contained to a very specific part of Sydney, so I would be urging that we move towards lifting those restrictions as soon as possible. We will be in a position tomorrow for Victorians affected to go online and make those applications for the payments, and there will be further updates provided by the minister for Services Australia later today to confirm those arrangements. So, with the PM slightly smirking behind her, Berejiklian has kind of clarified her call on the government to build and run its own quarantine facility in New South Wales, saying it was because NSW was at “capacity”. The point I was making is we are at our operational capacity. So if there was any proposal in the future, it wouldn’t come from us because we are at stretch point now. The expert advice is, New South Wales, once you get over 5,000, and sometimes 5,500 at any one time, when you creep up over that you are at a very high risk point. The point I made was we certainly wouldn’t be putting on a request to operate any additional facility because we don’t have the capacity, we are at capacity now. As the prime minister said, down the track, quarantine could look different once the majority of our population is vaccinated and international borders are open. That is a different question but at this point in time, we don’t have capacity, that’s the point I was making. I post the following with zero comment: Prime minister Scott Morrison and NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian have announced they are combining forces to fund a $500m bypass over the Hawkesbury River to solve “traffic issues.” From what I’ve understood, this will be a new bridge over the river, to relieve the “choke point” at the Richmond bridge. This, by the way, was the same bridge that flooded during the one-in-100-year rain event earlier this year. So, apparently the PM and the NSW premier are set to make a major infrastructure announcement at any time now. It looks like we’re going to have presser crossover. Excellent Monday morning. I want to go back to Gladys Berejiklian’s time on 2GB this morning, where she also piled pressure on to the federal government to find alternatives to hotel quarantine. She repeated her calls for the government to build and run its own dedicated quarantine hubs in NSW. We don’t know how long the pandemic is going to be with us and I just say to the feds 5,000 [people in quarantine] is all we can do in NSW at any one time. We need to think about when the vast majority of our population is vaccinated, international travel resumes, presumably quarantine will look a bit different to what it is now. The feds do have to consider what that means for the future of facilities. If they want extra capacity in NSW, they’re going to have to build and run it themselves. We’re not in the business of operating a federally-built quarantine facility The premier also said hotels couldn’t be used forever, especially if international borders opened again. In the meantime, New South Wales has recorded zero locally acquired cases today, but is reporting five cases in overseas travellers: Also of note is that in the week ending Sunday 6 June NSW delivered more than 80,000 vaccines, including more than 33,000 jabs administered at the Sydney Olympic Park vaccination centre. NSW has now administered just under 1.5 million vaccines in total, with nearly a million of those coming from the GP network. I’m hearing that the PM will be stepping up for a presser alongside NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian in the next half hour, which should be fun, but also I hope it doesn’t overlap with the Victorian presser. Please line them up, guys, please. ABC MD David Anderson has contradicted Christian Porter’s claims last week that the ABC is “humiliated”, that it had “backed down” and that it regretted the article the ABC published. The former attorney general gave a bullish press conference outside court last week in which he said the ABC had been “forced to say they regret the outcome of the reporting”. He said: They have been forced by my taking this action all the way to the court door, they have been forced to say they regret the article.. I never thought that they would concede that the accusations that were put in the article could never be proven. But Anderson told a Senate estimates hearing that the ABC was not humiliated and “did not regret the article”. All that had happened was an editor’s note had been attached to the article. Anderson said: The editor’s note said that both parties accept that some readers misinterpreted the article as an accusation of guilt against Mr Porter and that reading, not intended, was regretted. Senator, again I’ll just suggest that the editor’s note was agreed by both parties, and was affixed to the online article as [of] that Monday. Anderson stopped short of agreeing with a suggestion that what Porter said outside court was “nonsense”. Finally, the Victorian Department of Health has given *some* context, after dropping the numbers this morning without any explanation: This appears to be good news, but many people on Twitter are pointing out the needless anxiety that comes with just plonking numbers onto social media without an explanation, and without a time for the press conference. We are still waiting on the confirmation of the time for that presser as well. So, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has had her first dose of the Covid vaccine, and marked the occasion with a characteristic tweet and video: But there are some elements to this that need a second look. According to the premier, she got the Pfizer jab because... she has to go to the Olympics? Why does she need to go to the Olympics? I mean sure, perhaps to push for the 2032 Brisbane bid, but couldn’t it be a Zoom call? And also, with all the consternation around the AstraZeneca v Pfizer jab, it is interesting she has gotten the latter. Questions abound. Ben Roberts-Smith has arrived in court for the first day of his defamation hearing against three newspapers over their reporting of war crimes allegations against him. The Victoria Cross recipient walked into court alone, wearing a suit, and did not speak to waiting media, but greeted a well-wisher with a brief “thanks mate”. His mother, Sue, and father, Len, a judge and major general in the Australian army, hugged him in court when they arrived and took up seats behind him. Roberts-Smith will be the first person to give evidence in the case. He is expected to take the stand later this week. Roberts-Smith, 42, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018 which he alleges are defamatory because they portray him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes including murder. Roberts-Smith, 42, has consistently denied the allegations, saying they were “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. ABC managing director David Anderson is defending the broadcaster’s social media policy, after telling senators that Four Corners executive producer Sally Neighbour won’t be disciplined for an inaccurate tweet about Porter dropping his defamation action. Anderson said Neighbour’s tweet was inaccurate and he had contacted news chief Gaven Morris to tell him to contact her immediately and get her to take it down. Neighbour deleted it and followed up with an accurate tweet. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson asked him why the ABC didn’t follow the BBC’s lead and simply ban journalists from tweeting about certain subjects. Anderson said ABC staff were required to act in a certain way and the guidelines were “sophisticated and enforceable”. The ABC has also confirmed that a story published in the Australian last week saying the ABC had apologised to the judge for Neighbour’s tweet was incorrect. In completely normal Sydney news, Domain is reporting a house with no kitchen and no toilet in the south-east has sold for $4.07m at an auction this weekend. That’s right, no kitchen and no toilet. Over $4 million. Described as “uninhabitable”. The house in Kensington also has no power or water connected and a leaking roof. But that didn’t put off bidders. For some comparison, the previous owners bought the home for $1.1m in 2005. There were 1048 (!!) auctions in Sydney at the weekend, with 770 results reported. Which feels crazy. The National Australia Bank is facing an investigation after allegations of potentially serious and ongoing non-compliance with anti-money laundering laws were made in a letter from the industry watchdog, Austrac. In its letter to NAB, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre outlined serious concerns about the bank’s customer identification procedures, ongoing customer due diligence, and compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. Austrac’s enforcement team is now taking a look at the matter and will determine if any further action is required. Austrac has a wide range of enforcement options available to it, including civil penalty orders, enforceable undertakings, infringement notices and remedial directions. Speaking to the SMH, NAB boss Ross McEwan said it would cooperate with the investigation. We are very aware that we need to further improve our performance in relation to these matters. We have been working to improve and clearly have more to do. It is a key priority for everyone at NAB to uplift our financial crime capabilities, minimise risk to customers and the bank, and improve operational performance. That’s why we are so focused on getting the basics right every time to protect our customers and our bank. Queensland reports no news Covid cases The ABC will pay $100,000 in mediation costs to Christian Porter’s legal firm, ABC managing director David Anderson has told parliament. Under the agreement between the ABC and Porter, the ABC was given permission to tell the Senate details of the otherwise confidential agreement. So there’s a fair amount of anxiety making the rounds about today’s Covid numbers, especially since Melbourne is supposedly due to emerge from lockdown on Thursday. We’re still waiting on confirmation for when the press conference will be to hear what authorities have to say, but I thought Josh Taylor made a good point here: So, and this is speculation, but it is possible these numbers are just a ripple effect from the initial outbreak. But we will see. ABC managing director David Anderson was up at Senate estimates at 9am this morning after he was recalled to be questioned about the end of the Christian Porter defamation suit, which the former attorney general dropped last week. The MD is expected to be grilled about the details of the confidential agreement with Porter after the Australian reported that Porter would receive “a sum in the vicinity of $100,000 from the ABC” – a claim the ABC denies. A spokesperson said: The ABC has not and will not pay any amount to Mr Porter. ABC managing director David Anderson has been asked to appear before the Senate estimates committee on Monday 7 June and will have the opportunity to respond to a range of issues. The original reporting on this matter remains unaltered on the public record and we stand by our journalists and the work they do in the public interest. Our staff are aware of their responsibilities under the ABC’s ‘personal use of social media’ guidelines and the processes in place to ensure compliance with those guidelines. We are also expecting some questions about the ABC’s social media policy. Victoria is reporting 11 new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to midnight last night. But the good news is that more than 17,000 vaccine dose were administered, and more than 24,000 tests taken. The two cases announced yesterday – a nurse and a resident at an aged care facility – are also included in those numbers. We’re still waiting for today today’s Covid numbers out of Victoria, but since we’re previewing what’s coming up, I thought I’d also add that ABC boss David Anderson will be quizzed in estimates today, which should be interesting in light of his decision to delay the airing of a Four Corners episode that looked at the PM’s ties to a a QAnon conspiracy theorist. Deputy PM Michael McCormak, looking absolutely freezing this morning, received his own jab today, and indicated that he thought some vaccine complacency had come with Australia’s “strong” response to the pandemic. It is a worldwide effort to combat this insidious virus but Australia has done very well when you consider America. We have had one death this year. We have done very well and that has led to a level of complacency across the community. I will get the jab and I will get it whenever. I say to Australians make sure you do. Don’t wait. Get the jab when you’re eligible to do so and do it for yourself and for your community. More (ex) politicians on morning shows! This time, it’s former PM Malcolm Turnbull on RN Breakfast throwing his support behind vaccine passports, both domestic and international. Turnbull said the idea was sound and that vaccine hesitancy needed to be addressed. I know people will say this is tough, this is non-libertarian. [But] we need to be able to have good records so people can authoritatively and accurately say whether or not they have been vaccinated. Australians have to be tough about this and make it very clear that there are some things you will not be able to do if you are not vaccinated. Similar to no jab, no play. But if you want to work in healthcare, if you want to work in aged care [and] if you want to get on an airplane, if you want to go to a cinema, we are entitled to say you can’t do it to protect the rest of the community. A virus can spread at the speed of a jet airplane. So we cannot treat this as just a one-in-100-year event. We’ve got to make sure we we don’t waste this crisis. So just on those Newspoll results, I thought I’d give it a bit of a rundown as we head into the rest of the day. So the Coalition drew level with Labor on a two-party preferred basis for the first time in months, leaving them at 50-50. Support for the Coalition rose from 49% in May, with the last time the parties deadlocked being in February. On a primary vote basis, however, the Coalition still leads Labor 41-36. Backing for the Greens dropped a percentage point to 11, while One Nation’s primary vote rose from 2 to 3%. PM Scott Morrison’s numbers dropped pretty sharply, from 58% in mid-May to 54%, but Labor’s Anthony Albanese’s approval rating also dropped from 39% to 38%. And in terms of who would make a better prime minister, Morrison maintains his lead over Albanese, with 53% backing Morrison compared to 32% for Albanese. Sticking with politicians on morning shows, senator Jacquie Lambie was on the Today Show saying the latest Newspoll results should give the PM a jolt. If this hasn’t been a kick up the backside, I don’t know how else to get him to better manage Covid. He needs to stop saying it is the states or the premier down here or whatever. Start taking responsibility for your lack of actions. I just don’t think he has been on top of his game since he got in. Covid has knocked him around. I don’t think he has handled it as well as what he probably could have. It of course comes after the PM’s approval rating dropped from 58 % to 54 %, according to the poll. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian was on the radio this morning saying NSW should receive a “fair share of the vaccine” after federal health minister Greg Hunt yesterday announced Victoria will be receiving an extra 330,000 vaccines. Speaking on 2GB, Berejiklian said the outbreak in Victoria looked under control and it was only fair NSW received it’s “fair share”. Anything we can do to help we should, [but] I think fair is fair and we should just receive based on the size of every state. We are taking in lots of bodies every week through the airport and we do it because it’s the right thing to do. We have a lot on our shoulders as well. I think it’s only fair that we get our fair share of the vaccine. NSW has had similar if not larger outbreaks and we’ve dealt with things as we’ve seen fit. I just think moving forward we just have to offer states an incentive for doing the right thing, offer states an incentive for getting on top of things and I hope that’s the way things happen in the future. Straight out of the gates this morning (or lingering from last night – it’s a matter of perspective) is Labor Senator Kristina Keneally, releasing a joint statement with Catherine King, calling for an “urgent review” of security at Australia’s airport. It comes after a report from 60 Minutes yesterday, followed up by reports in the Sydney Morning Herald, alleged that Qantas had been infiltrated by organised crime to facilitate drug importation. Keneally described the revelations as “deeply disturbing” and said it was “frustrating” the Coalition had “held up” changes to airport security legislation, although it is unclear how that would stop alleged criminals being hired by Qantas. Of note also was Australia Criminal Intelligence Commission boss Mike Phelan saying Australia “has an insatiable demand for all types of drugs”. Make of that what you will. Some tweets now to visualise those Newspoll results: Good morning and happy Monday to all. My name is Mostafa Rachwani and I will be guiding you through the news this morning. We begin with a poll of over 1,000 people that found that 75% of Australians support compulsory Covid vaccines for aged care staff, coming on the heels of last week’s national cabinet meeting, where the idea was being seriously considered. It comes after Victoria recorded four cases yesterday, including a 79-year-old resident and a nurse at an aged care centre. The resident lives in “close proximity” to the previous two cases from the Arcare aged care home in Maidstone. It also comes after Western Australia was put on alert after a returned overseas travelled tested positive after leaving hotel quarantine. There are now a number of potential exposure sites and the man is back in hotel quarantine. In federal politics, health minister Greg Hunt announced an extra 330,000 vaccines would be directed to Victoria, and said people should seize the “moment of momentum” and get a jab. And according to Newspoll, the Coalition has pulled level with Labor on a two-party-preferred basis, but prime minister Scott Morrison’s support has nosedived in the wake of the vaccine rollout.","charCount":"22694","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mostafa-rachwani-\">Mostafa Rachwani</a>"},{"headline":"From board member to gardener, in Australia’s aged care we are all on the brink","standfirst":"<p>We feel the grip of winter and Covid returning, and we are trying to find our feet in the face of too many risks and not enough resources</p>","trailText":"We feel the grip of winter and Covid returning, and we are trying to find our feet in the face of too many risks and not enough resources","byline":"Anonymous","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dba7082f2933e24cc89b66e45408ff19a24f16a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dba7082f2933e24cc89b66e45408ff19a24f16a/0_361_5150_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurse supporting elderly woman.

At a time when traumatic brain injuries are coming into sharp focus, the last thing boxing needs is another reason for the detractors to shout louder.

No one will ever stop the boxing business from grinding out the dollars, but if something catastrophic were to happen here on Sunday night, the chances of this kind of event happening in the future would recede. Fighters train for a reason. Paul is not a fighter, he never will be. The devil, however, is in the numbers. Jake Paul, Logan’s younger brother, reportedly brought in 1.3m views for his most recent fight in April against mixed martial artist Ben Askren and generated around $75m.

The problem is, we shouldn’t have been here in the first place. Let Mayweather, if he wants, come back and fight real boxers. Seeing the likes of Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr attempt to roll back the years was hard to watch but somewhat acceptable. Logan can keep springing his pranks for his millions of fans of YouTube.

The CDU, whose current leader, Armin Laschet, will vie for the top job in September, improved on its 2017 performance to gain 37% of the vote in the eastern state, according to public service broadcaster ARD early on Monday. Reiner Haseloff, the state premier, said the result symbolised “a clear demarcation against the far right”. The nationalist Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD) came second on 21% but underperformed in light of some polls that had suggested the far right would challenge the CDU for the top spot. The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, expressed his relief at the AfD’s disappointing night, calling the outcome “a victory for democracy”. Governed for the last five years by a “Kenya coalition” between the CDU, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and Greens, Haseloff could, in the next electoral term, switch to a power-sharing deal with the SPD and the pro-business Free Democratic party (FDP) – known as a “Germany coalition”, after the colours of the national flag – or a “Jamaica” alliance with FDP and Greens. After a string of sobering results in state elections this spring, Sunday’s result amounted to “almost something like a comeback” for Merkel’s conservatives, wrote Der Spiegel. The CDU secretary general, Paul Ziemiak, described the outcome of Sunday’s vote as a “sensationally good result”. Laschet had ruled out any form of power-sharing deal with the AfD in the run-up to the vote, saying his party’s “firewall” against the far right would stand firm. Home to 2.2 million people, the Saxony-Anhalt state election does not reflect the standing of the six leading parties in the country as a whole. Support for the AfD, for one, is considerably higher and stable here than in other areas of Germany, in spite of its eastern branches pursuing more openly xenophobic policies. But as the last state election before the national vote in September, the outcome will be eagerly examined for hints at broader underlying dynamics. The lagging appeal of the leftwing Die Linke party and centre-left SPD in this area of what was once part of the socialist German Democratic Republic is representative of a broader malaise of the German left. On 10.7% of the vote, Die Linke lost 5.6% of votes compared with its 2016 results – its worst result in this eastern state since the party’s foundation in 2007. Support for the SPD dropped to 8.2%, one of the party’s worst results at a state election full stop. The Green party, which is still performing strongly in national polls, traditionally struggles in the German east, and will be the weakest of six parties in the next state parliament, on 6% of the vote. “We improved our result,” said the Green co-leader and chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock, “but not in the way we had hoped to.” The Greens, who even leapfrogged the CDU in some surveys after Baerbock was unveiled as candidate, have lost some momentum in recent weeks as other parties from across the political spectrum have started concentrating their fire on Green policies, such as a gradual fuel price increase. The Free Democratic party, which is enjoying a nationwide resurgence fuelled by some frustration with the pandemic management of Merkel’s government, re-entered parliament in Saxony-Anhalt on 6.5% of the vote, ahead of the 5% threshold for parliamentary representation. The FDP, a traditional junior ally of the CDU that shares its aversion to household debt, has also seen an upswing in support at a national level. Party leader Christian Lindner said he interpreted the result as a vote of support for his party’s economic competence and suggested reforms in the areas of digitalisation and education. The CDU’s strong showing in Saxony-Anhalt likely has much to do with personality: Haseloff, who has been state premier here for a decade, enjoys approval ratings of 81%.

Thanks for reading and we’ll be back in a few hours with more rolling coverage of the pandemic. Meanwhile, you can find all our coronavirus stories, features and analysis here. Key developments from the past few hours: The UK recorded 5,341 cases on Sunday, an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,111 cases were reported. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. Ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens, the health secretary said. Sunday is the first day for 12-16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, after 55% of the population have so far received two doses in the country. Morocco will reopen its airports to international traffic starting from 15 June to help the return of its nationals living abroad Staff of a senate committee investigating the handling of the pandemic in Brazil have said that the Copa America football tournament should not be held amid the world’s second-deadliest outbreak and must be postponed. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, re-imposed a strict lockdown that included the closure of schools and the suspension of inter-district travel. Victorians are being warned there is no ‘magic number’ of the people getting vaccinated before future lockdowns can be avoided. That’s all from me tonight. Thank you all for following along with me! First lady Jill Biden and Dr Anthony Fauci toured a Covid-19 vaccination site at a historic Harlem church on Sunday. AP reports, Biden, Fauci and US Sen Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, watched as people got their shots in the basement of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. Biden asked a teenager about to get his shot how old he was, and when he said he was 14, she responded, “You’re 14, that’s exactly what we want! Twelve and over.” The Abyssinian Baptist Church has often hosted elected officials and other dignitaries, including in February when former President Bill Clinton and former Sen. Hillary Clinton attended a memorial service for actor Cicely Tyson. The church first started offering vaccine doses in January in an effort to boost the vaccination rates in New York City’s Black and Hispanic communities. Victorians are being warned there is no ‘magic number’ of the people getting vaccinated before future lockdowns can be avoided, AAP reports. Four new cases were reported on Sunday, including two linked to the Arcare Maidstone aged care facility in the city’s northwest. Victoria’s Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng said it was challenging to say what proportion would need to be vaccinated to avoid future lockdowns. Pro Cheng said, “There isn’t one single magic number. “Once you get up to much higher coverage rates, then it makes a whole lot of things easier. “We may not need the intensity of restrictions. We may be able to only do contact tracing without having to do other things quite to the same level, and that is the benefit of vaccination.” But Prof Cheng expects that Melbourne will be able to ease restrictions on Friday, saying, “We don’t want to be in this any longer than we need to. So if we can, we will lift it early.” Brazil has recorded 39,637 new cases in the past 24 hours and 873 deaths, the health ministry said on Sunday. The numbers reflect a weekend drop – in both cases and deaths – on a rolling seven-day average. Brazil is reporting more than 1,800 deaths a day. The country has now registered 16,947,062 cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 473,404, according to ministry data, in the world’s third-worst outbreak outside the United States and India, and its second-deadliest. The UK correspondent for the Italian news outlet La Repubblica, Antonello Guerrera, reports that the Spanish football captain Sergio Busquets has tested positive for Covid-19. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, re-imposed a strict lockdown that included the closure of schools and the suspension of inter-district travel to help beat back a surge in Covid-19 cases. The new measures will be effective from Monday morning. Reuters reports, Most of the new restrictions, Museveni said, would be implemented for 42 days. An assessment of their impact will then help the government decide whether to ease or prolong them, he added. Uganda implemented one of Africa’s tightest lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, but it was gradually lifted as cases slowed to a trickle. However, last month infections started to rise and new cases, particularly among younger people, have surged, fuelling fears that the country could slip into an out-of-control second wave. Museveni said in a televised address on Sunday night that a second wave gripping the country was “diffuse and sustained”. The government, he said, was worried the jump in cases would “exhaust the available bed space and oxygen supply in hospitals unless we constitute urgent public health measures”. “In this wave the intensity of severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients and death is higher than what we experienced in the first wave of the pandemic,” he said. Covid-19 infections in Uganda are on an average daily basis at their peak, with 825 new infections reported each day, according to a Reuters analysis. From January to April the positivity rate in tested samples was mostly below 3% but the rate started climbing sharply last month, hitting 18% on 2 June, according to health ministry data. The east African country has thus far reported nearly 53,000 positive cases and 383 deaths. The new restrictions potentially threaten to arrest an already fragile economic recovery from the blow inflicted by last year’s lockdown. Those restrictions contributed to a 1.1% economic contraction in 2020, but the finance ministry had projected before Sunday’s new measures that growth would climb to between 4% and 5% in the fiscal year starting in July. The US has administered 301,638,578 Covid-19 jabs and distributed 371,520,735 doses as of Sunday morning, the CDC said. The latest figures are up from the 300,268,730 vaccine doses the CDC said had been administered by 5 June out of 371,520,975 doses delivered. The agency also said 170,833,221 people had received at least one dose while 138,969,323 people are fully vaccinated as of Sunday. Staff of a senate committee investigating the handling of the pandemic in Brazil have said that the Copa America football tournament should not be held amid the world’s second deadliest outbreak and must be postponed. Brazil was announced as host of the Copa America competition after joint-host Colombia was removed because of civil unrest and Argentina pulled out owing to a surge in Covid-19 cases. In a letter to the national football team, the senate commission said the country had only vaccinated 10.77% of the population until Friday with first doses. The commission said: “Brazil does not offer sanitary security for holding an international tournament of this magnitude. In addition to transmitting a false sense of security and normality, opposite to the reality that Brazilians are living, it would encourage agglomerations of people and set a bad example. “We are not against Copa America in Brazil or anywhere else. But we believe the tournament can wait until the country is ready to host it.” Reuters reports that the letter added that not holding the tournament in the country or participating in it would be a gesture of those who have lost their lives to the pandemic. The letter came two days after the captain of the Brazil football team said the squad would be making a statement on Tuesday about whether or not they want to compete in the competition. Brazilian media reports said the players do not want to play in a hastily arranged tournament due to kick off in a week while they are busy playing to qualify for the World Cup next year. After more than 15 months in varying degrees of lockdown, the US is finally ready to reopen this summer – and the signs are that plenty of people are beginning to emerge into the light, with their wallets loaded and their hearts seeking song, dance and travel. Sixty-three per cent of US adults have now received at least one vaccine dose, and as life returns to “normal”, hotels and concerts are selling out, rental cars and rental homes are booked up, and visits to museums and events are soaring. The rebound is happening so fast it’s being compared to the Roaring 20s when people came out from the gloom of a devastating flu pandemic and a global war to foxtrot and make merry. But there is a catch. Prices of some goods are soaring as shortages of lumber, chicken, and other products meet higher demand, stoking fears of inflation. A key inflation indicator – the personal consumption expenditures index – rose to 3.1% in April from a year earlier as price pressures built. And as restaurants and bars welcome back revellers, many are struggling to hire staff to cope with the demand. So far, however, rising prices have not dampened people’s enthusiasm for events and trips. In Tennessee, tickets for the Bonnaroo music festival sold out in record time, as did the Electric Daisy and Rolling Loud festivals, held in Las Vegas and Miami, respectively, as musicians and artists return to touring after more than a year of staying home. The 100,000 tickets for the Astroworld festival in Houston sold out in 30 minutes, its organizer said. “Fans are buying tickets, and events are selling out faster than ever,” Michael Rapino, chief executive of the Live Nation ticket company, said this month. “We’re just seeing demand beyond any other historic moment.” More on the story by Adam Gabbatt and Sajina Shrestha in New York, here: The US will donate 750,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan, a cross-party delegation of US senators said as they arrived in the country. AFP report that the high-profile delegation and gift come as Taiwan accuses China of hampering its efforts to secure enough doses as part of Beijing’s ongoing campaign to keep the island isolated. Morocco will reopen its airports to international traffic starting from 15 June to help the return of its nationals living abroad, the country’s foreign ministry said on Sunday. Foreign nationals will also be allowed into the country if they have been vaccinated against Covid-19 or had a negative PCR test. According to a tally compiled by AFP, since the outbreak first emerged in December 2019, at least 3,723,381 people have died from Covid-19. The US is the worst affected country, with 597,377 deaths from 33,357,240 cases. The next hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 472,531 deaths, India with 346,759, Mexico with 228,754 and Peru with 186,073. The WHO estimates the pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records because of the excess mortality directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19. Sunday is the first day for 12-16-year-olds in Israel to get vaccinated, after 55% of the population have so far received two doses in the country. The move to vaccinate teenagers came despite the country’s health ministry recently releasing finding that suggests a “possible link” between the Pfizer/BioNTech jab and cases of myocarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle – among younger men. Ministers are ‘absolutely open’ to delaying the 21 June reopening date in England if the Delta variant worsens the country’s recovery prospects, the health secretary said. Matt Hancock, in what is thought to be the clearest indication yet that the target date could be missed, stressed that 21 June was a “not before” date and that it was only “pencilled in” as the next step out of lockdown, PA reports. The minister also implied that social distancing could continue beyond the final stage of the roadmap. Pushed on whether the removal of restrictions date could be postponed if the Delta variant data “gets bad”, Hancock told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “We are absolutely open to doing that if that’s what needs to happen. “We said in the roadmap that June 21 is the date by which we would not take Step 4 before that date and that we would look at the data. “That is exactly what we are doing, so the roadmap was set up in order to be able to take these sort of changes into account.” As of Sunday, 27,957,453 people received their first dose in France, and 13,709,004 people have completed their vaccine cycle. The country also reported 5,070 new Covid-19 cases. France recorded 25 new deaths and 2 new ICU admissions on Sunday. The latest figures are added to a total of 83,572 deaths in hospital since the pandemic began and 2,527 people currently in the hospital for Covid-19. Health experts remain divided over the dangers posed by the new Delta variant of Covid-19 and the risks it poses to the nation as ministers consider whether or not to lift lockdown later this month. Some argue that the new variant, first identified in India, is a significantly increased threat to the UK and have urged that delays be imposed on the total removal of social restrictions, due on 21 June. “By the government’s own criteria, it would be foolish now to proceed on the data that we’ve got. The risk would be very great indeed,’ said Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) which advises the government. Reicher said the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by the appearance of the Delta variant was “not upheld”. This view was backed by scientists of the Independent Sage group, who argued that data indicated the Delta variant had higher infectivity and was more likely to cause disease and hospitalisations. “That makes it very difficult to justify progressing with the last stage of lockdown,” the group said last week. Other scientists believe such calls are premature. While urging caution, they say fears that the Delta variant poses a significant new threat – both in terms of infectivity and as a cause of serious illness – are premature. “The suggestion that the India variant is more pathogenic needs to be taken with a big dose of salt,” said Ian Jones, professor of virology, Reading University. More on the story here: Italy recorded 51 deaths and 2,275 new cases on Sunday, the health ministry has said. The latest figures are down from yesterday’s 57 deaths and 2,436 cases. Patients in hospital with Covid-19, not including those in intensive care, were recorded at 4,963 on Sunday, down from 5,193 a day earlier. There were 20 new admissions to intensive care units, unchanged from Saturday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 774 from a previous 788. Since the pandemic began in February, Italy has registered 126,523 coronavirus-related deaths, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eight-highest in the world. Portugal’s prime minister has criticised Britain for removing the country from the green list, allowing travellers to visit Portugal without quarantine on return. On Sunday, Antonio Costa urged London to adhere to a European digital certificate scheme to ease travel. Last week, Britain announced it was removing Portugal from its green list because of rising Covid-19 case numbers and the risk posed by coronavirus variants detected in Portugal. Costa told reporters, “We can’t have this system of instability and changes every three weeks.It isn’t good for those who plan their holidays, nor for those who have to organise the tourism industry to receive tourists in good conditions.” Costa adds that Portugal was maintaining a dialogue with the British government to “explain the decision is not justified and also the serious damage it causes to the British and to the Portuguese economy.” Reuters reports that under the proposed European digital certificate scheme, which the EU plan to introduce from 1 July, EU citizens who can prove they have been vaccinated against Coivd-19, tested negative for the disease or recovered from it will be able to travel freely in the bloc. However, the prime minister did not explain how Britain would adhere to the scheme after leaving the EU. The Covid-19 situation in Portugal has seen a slight increase in positive cases since lifting lockdown restrictions last month. Hospitalisations remain low and daily deaths are near zero following the vaccination of nearly all its most vulnerable elderly citizens. Hi, I’m Edna Mohamed; I’ll be taking over from my colleague Harry Taylor for the rest of the afternoon. If I miss anything, you can message me on Twitter or drop me an email at edna.mohamed.casual@theguardian.com The UK records 5,341 positive coronavirus cases on Sunday and four new deaths, according to government data. This is an increase of 2,101 on last Sunday when 3,240 cases were reported. While daily deaths are down -1% in the last seven days, case numbers are up by 11,022 (49.0%) in the same period. Here’s a round-up of today’s latest coronavirus news from around the world: Eradicating Covid-19 worldwide is not a “reasonable target”, according to a World Health Organization envoy on the virus. Dr David Nabarro said people will have to learn to live with the virus in circulation. Boris Johnson has outlined his ambition to see the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall starting on Friday. He will also call for a global watch system to identify new variants. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. UK health secretary Matt Hancock says it’s “too early” to make a final decision on whether there will be a delay to restrictions being relaxed on 21 June. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair has called for the rules to be relaxed for people who have had both doses of the vaccine, and for Covid-certification for travel. More than 57m doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to people in England, latest NHS England data shows. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. UK government ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive and 123,436 have died. Russia’s own statistics service suggests the actual number to die from the virus may be higher. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. A further 74 people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll stands at 89,222. No deaths have been reported from Covid in Wales for the tenth day in a row, according to the latest public health statistics. A total of 92 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the number of infections recorded in the country to 213,091. 5,569 people have died. Campaigners have criticised Boris Johnson for his “audacity” in calling for the world’s population to be vaccinated by the end of next year (see 08:31), accusing him of blocking attempts to scale up production. Global Justice Now said the UK is one of the countries, along with Germany, which is stopping an intellectual property waiver on vaccines and treatments at the World Trade Organization. India and South Africa first proposed a waiver eight months ago, but some countries have obstructed it. The US said last month it would support a waiver. The director of the charity, Nick Dearden, said: “The audacity of Boris Johnson preaching about the need to vaccinate the world is staggering. The UK is one of the last remaining countries blocking an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines. “Simply setting a deadline is not leadership. If the prime minister wants to achieve global vaccination by 2022, he should follow in Joe Biden’s footsteps and support an intellectual property waiver on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.” More than 57 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have now been given to people in the UK, latest NHS England data shows. The total – 57,193,641 jabs – include both first and second jabs. The latest figures show a total of 590,645 people were vaccinated yesterday. Nearly 23.5 million people have had both doses of the vaccine, with 33.7 million having had at least one jab. Ministers are considering giving people a different type of Covid vaccine as an autumn booster, it has emerged, after early results from “mix and match” trials appeared to show promise for an enhanced immune response. Four different coronavirus jabs have been approved for use in the UK, with more under regulatory review. While people are currently offered two doses of the same jab, researchers have been exploring whether offering a second dose of a different Covid vaccine could generate a stronger immune response. It is also expected that people will be offered a third, “booster” injection, potentially in the autumn, in part to protect them against variants with some resistance to existing vaccines. One possibility being looked at is that this third jab could be of a different type to people’s initial two, a government source said. Trials worldwide are exploring the impact of max and match doses. In the UK, the Com-Cov study, launched in February, is investigating the possibility of using the Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax vaccines. The Sunday Telegraph reported promising results from separate trials of more than 600 people in Spain and 300 in Germany. Matt Hancock has formally denied the claim from Dominic Cummings that he incorrectly promised people discharged from hospitals to care homes were being tested for Covid at the start of the pandemic, saying: “No, I did not.” The rejection, after lengthy questioning on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, follows the health secretary’s previous refusal to deny explicitly the claim in the Commons and at a Downing Street press conference, a day after Cummings’ explosive claims to MPs. But in an indication of Hancock’s likely approach when he is quizzed by the same parliamentary committee on Thursday, he argued that Cummings had not in fact accused him of wrongly claiming tests were already being done in March last year – only that they would happen when testing capacity was available. Eradicating Covid-19 from the world is not currently a “reasonable target”, a World Health Organization Covid-19 official has said. Dr David Nabarro, a special envoy to the WHO, said people will have to learn to live with the disease, comments which were echoed by Dame Anne Johnson, a professor of infection disease epidemiology at University College London (UCL). Nabarro told Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we’re going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future. “Eradication is not currently a reasonable target for the world.” He said: “Each time there is a sudden surge, it does stimulate in one’s mind the thought that there might be a new variant appearing. That wouldn’t be surprising.” He said that will be “the pattern for the future”, adding: “This virus isn’t going away any time soon, there will be variants emerging.” A Dublin pub landlord has said the hospitality industry in Ireland faces difficulties replacing staff who left during the pandemic. Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O’Donoghue’s, told PA Media he has been fortunate to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure. Others have struggled to recruit staff and are finding it hard to fill roles ahead of reopening. “We’ve only lost one for the moment and hopefully we’ll get him back by the end of the summer. So we’ve been lucky enough – we’ve retained the majority of the staff here, which has been great.” Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff have received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support. “They’ve obviously had to take a hit and they all have families and mortgages and bills to pay as well,” said Barden. It’s a month tomorrow since Public Health England published a report on the India variant in the UK when there were 509 identified cases. Since then the case numbers in the country have risen 20-fold and case numbers are continuing to rise. This thread from PHE expert Meaghan Kall on where things in England are now is well worth a read: Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are looking to develop their home-grown vaccines as supply shortages threaten efforts to tackle the pandemic. Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are hoping to develop their own jabs after struggling to get vaccines from overseas, according to the South China Morning Post. While locally developed vaccines aren’t likely to affect the pandemic in its current phase, they believe it’s a better long-term approach. Germany has registered 2,440 new cases in the last 24 hours, and 24.7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute. The latest figures show 74 more people have died from the virus, meaning the death toll now stands at 89,222. There has been a total of 3,700,367 positive tests for Covid since the start of the pandemic. The new Delta variant of coronavirus appears to be about 40% more transmissible than the variant it has largely replaced, Matt Hancock has said, making government decisions about whether to ease restrictions in England on 21 June “more difficult”. Saying that under-30s will be called to begin vaccinations from next week, the health secretary confirmed it was still possible the reopening programme could be delayed or some rules kept in place. “We consider all options,” he told Sky News. Away from the UK, Russia has reported 9,145 new Covid-19 cases and a further 399 deaths. A total of 5,117,274 people have tested positive in the country. The death toll in the country now stands at 123,436. Russia’s own state statistics service, Rosstat, keeps its own records and said on Friday that about 270,000 people had died from the virus and related causes as of April. Excess deaths in the county stand at 425,000 from between April 2020 and April 2021. Marr rounds off by asking whether the health secretary regretted using the phrase about a “protective ring” around care homes. “I said that much later about what we were doing for the winter plans, but it’s been interpreted,” he says, but changes the subject on to the return of children to school tomorrow after half-term. “On testing, tomorrow schoolchildren will be going back to school. You must get tests done this evening because right now secondary school-age children getting their tests done tonight is the most important thing that can be done today.” Marr asks whether Hancock will apologise for any failings on his part during the pandemic, as Cummings did. “At that time everybody was working as hard as possible to protect as many lives as possible on the evidence we had at the time,” he says. “This is true of different administrations and across the whole of Europe. “I know those decisions were taken on the best evidence with the best of intentions.” Marr ends by asking whether Hancock’s been honest and transparent during the pandemic after claims made by Dominic Cummings during his select committee appearance last week. He plays a clip of Cummings saying that in March 2020 Hancock said people would be tested before they went back to care homes and there was a protective shield around them. “It’s complete nonsense,” Cummings said. He asks Hancock whether he told Johnson that people would be tested before they went into care homes. He replies: “We know the testing wasn’t available to test everybody. The advice was that very few people would be able to pass on Covid if they didn’t have any symptoms, so we reserved that for people with symptoms. “The situation with regards to care homes, we brought in a policy of wanting to test everybody going into a care home as soon as we had those tests available. Everyone had a challenge around Europe, in Scotland in Wales, some of the most vulnerable to Covid live in care homes, but at the time, you’ll remember we didn’t have the testing capacity and I built that up, put in place the hundreds of thousands targets and then we could put that into place.” On the idea of children being vaccinated, Hancock says the government is following clinical advice. “There’s good advantages, there’s the reduction in transmission from children to parents and grandparents who might be vulnerable. There’s advantages in protecting education, if one child gets one positive test, the whole bubble has to isolate. “We should follow and listen to clinical advice … I don’t want to put pressure on them with their advice. People should be reassured that whatever steps we take they are on a clinically advised basis.” In response to a question about vaccine passports, or certification along the lines mentioned by Tony Blair, Hancock says: “We know some other countries are going to require it. So if you want to go some other countries, you already have to, the EU are talking about it. It’s my job to make sure you can have that. “If you download the NHS app right now and register it will show you your vaccine status, so you can prove it if you want to go to Greece, for example.” He says rules in the UK are down to a certification review and that there is downsides on a mandatory basis. Hancock repeats Sage’s findings that the India variant is 40% more transmissible. In turn Marr quotes a Sage report saying that a variant of that level of transmissibility would cause severe disruption to the roadmap. Hancock says: “We’re watching the case rates and the rate in which that transfers into hospitalisations. Thankfully that link, which was absolutely rock solid over the autumn, is severed but not broken. There are some people in hospital who have been double vaccinated, but very few. The majority in hospital haven’t been. “Critically, those who are double vaccinated, even if they’re in hospital, they appear to be less ill. The vaccine is working and is our way through it, the new variant, which is more transmissible is making that calculation harder.” Matt Hancock’s now appearing on Marr, after his earlier interview on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. He first responds to an earlier interview by Bob Geldof calling for more vaccines to go to developing countries. The health secretary references Boris Johnson’s call to get the planet vaccinated by the end of 2022, and the rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab at cost to low and middle income countries. The cut to the aid budget, he says, is supposed to be temporary. “We also have this enormous cost there, so we can continue investing in the NHS, which we are doing, but there’s many things we are doing, leadership on climate change and certainly the work that AZ and Oxford University have done that a quarter of the vaccines across the whole world are delivered with UK taxpayers cash, at cost, no charge on intellectual property, and that’s saving lives everywhere.” Nandy backs vaccination for children after the JCVI’s approval of the Pfizer jab for 12-15 year olds. “I think the regulator has been clear that for 12-year-olds and over the Pfizer vaccine is safe and it’s apparent that the rise in transmission rates is being driven by young people. “It’s right to follow the public health officials particularly the ones that are saying ‘this is what we want to do’. “If public health directors are saying ‘we’ve got a problem in our secondary schools and we need to open up the vaccine, not to make it mandatory, offer the chance to get them vaccinated’, then we need to listen. If we’d taken that approach from the start we’d be in a far better place now.” On international travel Nandy says she believes the current Amber list for international travel from the UK should be scrapped. Current rules mean people travelling to the UK from those countries must quarantine at home or the place they are staying for 10 days and take two Covid tests during that period. She adds: “It’s confusing and that confusion is dangerous at the moment and risks unravelling all the progress that we’ve made. “I think we should have robust quarantine measures for people coming back into the country. “We need to be much clearer that at the moment travelling overseas, particularly when you’ve got countries like Vietnam and Thailand on the amber list where new variants are emerging and being imported into the UK, is the wrong thing to do and the government ought to be clear about that.” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy tells Marr says she’s sceptical on a domestic level on vaccine passports. “I think the global case for vaccine passports is clear because other countries are doing it, but at a domestic level for many of the reasons that you’ve highlighted, discriminatory practices, how they would be enforced, I think there are potentially real problems.” Here’s more detail on the proposal put forward by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to travel abroad using a new digital pass and go to “vaccine-only” venues such as restaurants or sports stadiums, Tony Blair says today. Releasing a report entitled “Less Risk, More Freedom”, by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister says the time has come “to distinguish for the purposes of freedom from restriction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated”. The report argues that to date, measures intended to reduce the spread of disease have treated populations as largely homogenous groups. As a result, restrictions – such as national lockdowns, regional-tier systems and entire schools closed following outbreaks – have been blunt instruments. Tony Blair’s on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. He says he thinks it’s “uncertain” as to whether the UK will carry on with rules being relaxed on 21 June. Marr says that with introducing vaccine passports or certification status, it will end up discriminating against people who have not had the jab. Blair replies: “Discrimination has got a very loaded meaning in the English Language now. Really when it comes to risk management it’s all about discrimination. The reason we vaccinate the elderly first is that they are more at risk. The reason we ensure people are vaccinated is that we reduce the risk of transmission.” In response to a follow-up question, the former prime minister adds that there needs to be exemptions made for certain groups, including the disabled, as it would be “totally inappropriate” to discriminate against them. Taiwan reported 343 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from 511 reported the day before. The US announced on Sunday that it will give it 750,000 vaccine doses. Phillips asks if we could be giving more vaccines to other countries ahead of the G7 summit next week. Hancock says: “My first duty is to protect the UK population, and that’s to reduce transmission. The way we’re helping the rest of the world is giving away at cost the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and that means of the 2 billion doses delivered across the world, 500m doses are the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 70% of those doses are in low and middle-income countries. “The reason we’ve been able to do this is is that we’ve made it available at cost, no charge of intellectual property from the start. I’m delighted there’s a debate, around the G7 table on how to vaccinate the world, but this country has done more than any other by ensuring the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is available at cost.” Responding on whether the government will respond to Blair’s call earlier (see 8.19), for global vaccine passports, as well as relaxations domestically for people who have had the jab. Hancock says: “This debate has been going on for months and we’ve been doing the work inside government, and we’ll be coming out with our answers on that soon. “We know it’s going to be needed internationally, on the domestic front, that’s a matter for Michael Gove.” Phillips asks if the government will want to vaccinate all children. The UK regulator, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, approved the Pfizer jab for use on children aged between 12 and 15 earlier this week. A story in the Sunday Telegraph said that under plans drawn up by Whitehall, they would be offered the jab from mid-August. Hancock doesn’t rule it out, and says: “We’ve got a few weeks until we come out with a plan on how and if we take this forward. “We know the vaccine both protects you and helps stops it transmitting, and I want to protect education as much as anybody does. Making sure we don’t have those whole bubbles going home and the isolation, that has big upsides for education.” Under-30s in England will be invited to get their jabs this week, Hancock adds, as he says the link between infection and serious illness has been “severed but not broken” by the vaccine. Phillips asks whether there will be a modification of the roadmap, such as lifting lockdown but still asking people to work from home. “There are a series of things at the moment that we’ve said will be part of step four, which include the rule of six and the fact there’s still some businesses that are closed. “We have four reviews into international travel and certification and social distancing, and we are concluding those reviews and doing that at the same time.” Hancock urges people to go and get their second dose to try and stop the damage being caused by the India variant, that is 40% more transmissible. “It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective.” The health secretary Matt Hancock is on Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday, as part of a morning broadcast tour. He asks Hancock whether there will be a delay to the relaxing of restrictions on 21 June. “It’s too early to make a final decision on that,” Hancock begins. “The prime minister and the team will be looking over all the data over this week and we’ve said we will be giving people enough time ahead of 21 June when this is pencilled in, this next step.” He says it will depend on the four tests; cases, hospitalisations, the rollout of the vaccine and the impact of new variants. Hancock admits that there has been a significant impact of the Delta variant. Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to “defeat Covid” by vaccinating the world by the end of next year. The prime minister will stress the importance of the programme when he meets leaders on Friday in Cornwall for the first face-to-face G7 meeting since the beginning of the pandemic. The US, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have all said how many doses they will donate to the global vaccine programme, Covax. However the UK and Canada are yet to announce how many they will contribute. Johnson will also call for a global watch system to catch new variants before they spread more widely. Johnson said: “I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again.” Head of the UK vaccines taskforce Kate Bingham is to be given a damehood, the Telegraph has reported, after getting the UK access to millions of doses of six different jabs. Her expected honour is among a number in next week’s Queen’s Birthday honours dedicated to “heroes” in the pandemic. Bingham was appointed to the role in May last year and left at the end of 2020. People who have had both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should have restrictions relaxed for them, according to former prime minister Tony Blair. Blair’s thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, sets out how the country should remain open if the virus persists in the population. The report, Less Risk, More Freedom, says that the NHS app – which is currently used for contact tracing – should be replaced with a system of global health passes. “The health pass needs to be usable both by national border authorities and other organisations within countries. It should also include the ability to demonstrate time-restricted testing status for those who aren’t able to be vaccinated. “With this ability to securely prove vaccination status, we can move beyond blunt, catch-all tools and align with other countries by removing certain restrictions for the fully vaccinated – thereby enabling us to sustainably reopen the economy,” the report says.

The only way to respond to a nightmare back nine, as she came home in 40. She immediately sets up a straight 15-foot birdie chance this morning, but pulls it wide left.

She’s birdied 1 this morning, too, and currently stands at level par for the tournament. As things stand, she’s tied for eighth place.

She looked focused, bang in the zone, a study in determination. But all that intensity must have been mentally exhausting. A disappointing 73 on Friday, then a strange 78 yesterday that variously featured a shank, a whiffed chip and a hole-out from 100 yards for eagle. Out of contention, she’s already carded a couple of bogeys today, at 2 and 4, and has slipped down to +7. But when it all comes down, this week should give her plenty of confidence going forward. As a late bloomer in the majors, compared to your Lexis, Inbees and Lydias, she’s trending in the right direction.

But for one reason and another, it’s never quite happened. Three second places in the majors, three thirds, 16 top-ten finishes. It’s about that time, and yesterday’s flawless 66 was carpe-diem stuff. This is the first time she’s led the US Open after any round, a stat that might not say much about most 26-year-olds, but Thompson first played in this tournament in 2007 at the precocious age of 12. This is her 15th consecutive appearance. Is she finally going to land major number two?</p> <p><strong>Yuka Saso is best placed to stop her. </strong>The powerful Filipino spent most of yesterday’s round driving like Seve, but no matter, thanks to her ability to gouge back into position, as though the penal Olympic Club rough wasn’t there, and her scrambling skills around the greens; she chips a bit like Seve, too. If she wins today, she’ll join Inbee Park as the only teenage winner of the US Open. Park won in 2008 at 19 years, 11 months and 17 days; that’s Saso’s <em>exact age </em>today. Some things seem written.</p> <p><strong>Or could Megha Ganne become only the second amateur to win the US Open, matching the feat of Catherine Lacoste in 1967?</strong> The 17-year-old from New Jersey received vociferous support from the gallery yesterday, at one point getting to within a shot of the lead. When asked for her secret, she smiled: “I figure why not make it fun?” She’s the real deal.</p> <p><strong>Some big names are lurking, including 2019 champion Jeongeun Lee6, 2012 PGA winner Shanshan Feng, major champs in waiting Nasa Hataoka and Megan Khang, and seven-time major winner Inbee Park. </strong>Should Thompson and Saso hit their stride, it will be a two-woman race, but anything can happen at Olympic Club, and it can happen to the best of them: just ask Arnold Palmer, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/feb/25/joy-of-six-sporting-chokes\">lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper in the 1966 men’s version</a>.

She becomes only the second teenager to win the US Open, equalling the record Inbee Park set in 2008 exactly: 19 years, 11 months and 17 days. Commiserations to Nasa Hataoka, who pushed her all the way to a sudden-death play-off; also to Lexi Thompson, her back-nine collapse earning her a place in Olympic Club infamy alongside Arnold Palmer, who lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper in the 1966 men’s version. Hey, there’s worse company to find yourself in. Thanks for reading this hole-by-hole report. Nighty night! -4: Saso, Hataoka (Saso won play-off at first sudden-death hole) -3: Thompson -2: Khang, Feng E: Yin +1: Lin, Ko, A Jutanugarn, Henderson, Park +2: Olson, Lee6 +3: Herbin, Ganne (a) +4: Lee, Kim, Li, Stark (a) Megha Ganne is awarded her silver medal for low amateur, then Yuka Saso is given her Mickey Wright Medal. Finally she lifts the US Open trophy, deserved reward for a sensational victory. “My dream was to be world number one and win the US Open, but I wasn’t thinking I would hold this trophy this week. I am really happy. I knew there were par fives on the last few holes and maybe I could get my chance. After 18, I felt my stomach a little ... it hurts ... I don’t know why! But I ate banana and it feels better now. This means a lot.” Then a mention for Rory McIlroy, who she has modelled her swing on. “Rory mentioned me on Instagram, saying get that trophy, so I did. Thank you Rory!” Just a lovely speech from golf’s newest superstar! Yuka Saso’s victory this week will go down as a huge surprise, though perhaps it shouldn’t: she did tie for 13th last year, after all. The manner in which she bounced back from that dismal start - double bogey at 2, double bogey at 3 - was a demonstration of top-drawer sporting moxie. Her approaches at 16 and 17 put matchplay-style pressure on Lexi Thompson, who couldn’t cope. Just a 73 on the final day, and yet it’s a performance and a victory for the ages. Saso becomes only the second teenager to win the US Open. The first: Inbee Park, who was exactly the same age, 19 years, 11 months and 17 days, when she triumphed in 2008! That is very strange; sometimes the planets just align. After being warmly congratulated by the gracious Nasa Hataoka, then drenched in champagne, an understandably emotional Yuka Saso, the 2021 US Open champion, talks to NBC. How did she bounce back from that awful start? “I was upset and my caddy talked to me. He said there are still many holes to go, so keep what I was doing the last few days and trust the process. I was just glad and thankful that I was here and able to play in this tournament. It is unbelievable! I’d like to thank my family. I wouldn’t be here without them ... [some inevitable tears] ... I’m sorry ... to all my sponsors who helped me I am thankful ... to all my friends I am really thankful ... I hope I can do more and keep this going.” A perfectly judged right-to-left birdie putt drops, and the young Filipino wins her first major at the age of 19! Who would have thought this could happen when she double-bogeyed 2 and 3?! Hataoka rolls up to three feet. A short uphill one left for par. But will she get to make it? For the third time, Saso has a putt to win the US Open! Saso has made some outrageous escapes from the rough this week, and this might be her best! Her wedge cuts crisply through the cabbage, her ball biting eight feet from the pin! She’ll have a great look at birdie, and the pressure is really on Hataoka now, because her sand wedge from the centre of the fairway is weak, only just landing on the front of the green and spinning back a little. She’ll be left with a 30-footer. She needs something special. Hataoka still with the honour. She creams her drive down the middle of the fairway, about 100 yards from the hole. Saso’s drive however leaks off to the left, takes a hard bounce, and disappears into the filth. Advantage Hataoka with the roles reversed. Yep! She hits a supremely confident par saver into the heart of the cup, and we’re going to sudden death. Back to 9 with the pair of you. Hataoka 4-4 Saso 4-4 Saso goes for it ... and seriously overcooks it! To astonished gasps, she sends a fast one six feet past, the ball always staying on the high side. Can she knock in the return and take us back to the 9th? Hataoka strides around, in preparation for the biggest putt of her life. Eventually, all decisions made, she sends a well-paced putt to kick-in distance. It was never going to drop, mind, always staying up on the right. Another par, and for the second time today, Saso will have a putt for the US Open title! Saso next. She sends hers over the flag. The ball bites and threatens to spin back, but stops pretty much dead and she’ll have a look from 20 feet. Let the putting shootout commence. Hataoka to play first. She’s 103 yards out, in thick rough, halfway up the bank on the left. She does extremely well to smash her wedge onto the fringe at the front. The ball breaks to the right but just about holds the fringe. She’s pin high, and will be pleased with that outcome. She’s left with a 30-footer. Hataoka’s tee-box radar has gone on the blink at exactly the wrong time. She hooks her hybrid into the thick stuff down the left of the second play-off hole, the 18th. Saso splits the fairway. Advantage Saso once again. Saso up first. Her putt is always missing on the high side. She’ll have a three-foot tickler coming back. Hataoka then rolls her birdie effort straight at the cup ... but it stops a dimple short. She taps in for par, but only after asking whether this is a match-play style situation. It’s not. Saso cleans up, and we’re effectively sudden death now. Meanwhile NBC inform us that Lexi Thompson has declined the kind offer of an interview, which is hardly surprising given her back-nine collapse. Hataoka 4 Saso 4 Hataoka’s lie isn’t too awful, all things considering. After some deliberation, she bumps a glorious wedge into the front of the green, her ball working right to left, ending pin high. She’ll have an uphill look at birdie from 15 feet! Saso, from the short stuff, comes up 20 feet short. Ah the ebb and flow. NBC have a quick word with the low amateur, the extremely cheerful Megha Ganne. “No disappointment at all. I had a ton of fun, and expect to see me back here! I’m going back to school tomorrow. My friends and sister will definitely snap me back into reality.” Here we go, then. Hataoka has the honour, and hooks her drive into the cabbage down the left. Instant advantage to Saso, who turns the screw by whistling her drive down the right-hand side of the fairway. That’s gone one hell of a way. The play-off, then. It’s a two-hole aggregate affair, the players playing the 9th then the 18th. If they still can’t be separated, it goes to sudden death, alternating between 9 and 18. Golf, eh? Bloody hell! Anyway, we’re guaranteed a new major champion. Nasa Hataoka, 22 from Japan, has been threatening to make the breakthrough for a while, having tied for second at the 2018 PGA and third at the same event last year. She’s also got top-ten finishes at the ANA (2020) and the US Open (2018 at Shoal Creek) already on her CV. By comparison, Yuka Saso tied for 13th at last year’s US Open, and that’s it ... though the Filipino is only 19. Or, to be exact, 19 years, 11 months and 17 days, exactly the same age Inbee Park was when she won in 2008. Park is the only teenage winner of the US Open as things stand. Is a little bit of history about to be rewritten? Saso makes her par putt for a 73. That’s one hell of a salvage job, and she’s in a play-off with Hataoka! Meanwhile poor Thompson taps in for bogey. A 75 as uncertain as yesterday’s 66 was majestic. She shipped a five-shot lead, and while that’s not up there with Arnold Palmer’s antics here in 1966, when he lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper in the men’s version, this is going to be a tough one to process. Back in 41 with a bogey-bogey finish. Palmer never won another major after his debacle; let’s hope the same fate doesn’t befall the popular Thompson, who smiles graciously as she congratulates Saso and Ganne, who both exit the green beaming, one as low amateur, the other heading into a play-off! -4: Hataoka (F), Saso (F) -3: Thompson (F) -2: Khang (F), Feng (F) Thompson, for the par and a place in a playoff. She prods timidly at the putt, and it’s never, ever, ever reaching the hole. She laughs out loud at her mistake, but this is going to be a difficult one to get over. More on that anon, but first, Megha Ganne rattles in a par saver for a 77. Huge cheers as she’s the low amateur! Saso prowls, though she doesn’t take too long. A putt for the US Open. She sends the ball rolling serenely towards the cup ... it’s going in ... no it’s not. It turns to the right and she’s left with, under the circumstances, an extremely testing four footer coming back up to make a play-off! Thompson has a decent lie in the bunker. This has to go close. What if she Bob Tways it for the win? Nope. She’ll need to make a 15-footer coming back if she’s to make a play-off ... while now Saso, whose jig looked up after those double bogeys at 2 and 3, has a putt for the title! Thompson first, from 109 yards ... and yet again she comes up short, her 9-iron dunking into the bunker at the front. The door’s ajar for Saso, who from 98 yards, lands on the dancefloor. The ball spins back, shades of Sandy at Augusta in 1988, though not quite so close. She’ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet. Jeonguen Lee6 also pars, signing for a very disappointing final round of 76. She’s +2. Ah well, she’ll always have Charleston. Then Nasa Hataoka tidies up, and she’s carding a magnificent 68 that saw her make three birdies in the last six holes. It was so close to four. She’s set a mark at -4. Can either Saso or Thompson birdie the last to snatch it? -4: Hataoka (F), Saso (17), Thompson (17) -2: Khang (F), Feng (F) Saso clips her hybrid down the middle of the very narrow 18th fairway. The pressure’s really on Thompson now. Iron for safety. She whipcracks it down the track. What a response, especially in light of what’s just happened on 17. Up on the green, Hataoka rolls her birdie effort down the green. For a sweet second, it looks like dropping, but then veers off to the right. She should tap in for a 68, but nothing’s certain in this cauldron. Before that can happen, Shanshan Feng pars for a 71. She ends the week at -2. Thompson sends a tentative dribbler towards the hole, the ball breaking apologetically to the left. A little more pace would have taken the gentle break out of the equation. Saso taps in for birdie. And up on 18, Hataoka sends her second over the flag to 15 feet. Anything is on now! -4: Hataoka (17), Saso (17), Thompson (17) -2: Khang (F), Feng (17) Saso splashes from the big bunker to three feet. That’s really cranked up some matchplay-style pressure on Thompson, who having chunked a couple of chips today, opts to take putter from off the front. She clacks it to six feet. Massive putt coming up. But beforehand, some light relief - and a huge cheer - as Megha Ganne makes her first birdie of the day. Her smile is as wide as San Francisco Bay. She’s +3. Three putts for Megan Khang on 18, and while she’s the new clubhouse leader, the mark is only -2. Her flat stick has let her down this afternoon, though it was the four consecutive bogeys on the back nine yesterday that crushed her hopes. Saso, having bashed a fine drive down the right side of the 17th fairway, sends her hybrid into the bunker guarding the front left of the green. Up on 18, Hataoka swishes a controlled tee shot down the middle of the very narrow fairway. And back on 17, after great deliberation, Thompson leaves her approach a club short. “I hit that real good! I was staring that down. How stupid do I look?” Some light-hearted patter with her caddy there, but you can be sure she’ll be churning inside. She needs a big up and down from the apron at the front of the green to save par. Thompson’s lie is appalling, and she needs every fibre of her being just to lash 40 yards up the hole. She’s making a meal of this short par-five. But up on the green, Feng takes three putts from the fringe, the bogey dropping her back to -2. Hataoka, however, having dribbled her long downhill birdie effort six feet past, knocks in the return to save her par. She departs the scene with a spring in her step. Penny for the thoughts of Thompson, back up the hole, looking the other way, trying to rediscover the exact location of The Zone. The nerves are really kicking in now. Thompson pulls her drive on 17 into the thick stuff down the left. She’ll not be able to reach from there, surely. Up on 18, Khang’s tee shot finds the cabbage down the right, but she gouges a wedge onto the green. She’s a ways from the flag, but that’s a result from where she was. Two putts, and she’ll be setting a new clubhouse lead at -3. Feng can’t reach the par-five 17th in two from the rough. She doesn’t reach it in three, either, coming up short with her wedge. Hataoka sends her second into thick rough guarding the front, her hybrid hanging up in the breeze. It’s doubly unlucky, because she was inches away from toppling into the bunker, leaving a relatively easy splash. As it is, her ball comes out hot. She’ll have a tricky two putts for par. Khang isn’t quite finished yet. She lands her approach at 17 a couple of feet from the cup, and tidies up for birdie. She moves to -3. Meanwhile back on 16, Thompson lets her six-foot birdie effort dribble nervously below the cup and she has to settle for par. Saso, having screeched her wedge to three feet, makes birdie. This has become very interesting indeed. -5: Thompson (16) -4: Hataoka (16) -3: Khang (17), Feng (16), Saso (16) Lexi takes a long time over her approach. Can you blame her? This is one of the biggest shots she’ll have played for a long while. She lands her wedge in the middle of the green, spin putting the brakes on and turning it left, to within six feet of the cup! Meanwhile up on 17, Hataoka whistles a drive down the middle, while Feng picks the wrong time to miss her first fairway of the day. Knowing she needs a birdie here at the very least, her shoulders drop a little. Thompson isn’t minded to take any unnecessary risks, and lays up with her second at 16. She’s in good nick, 100 yards out, in the middle of the fairway ... which is just as well, because up on the green, Hataoka makes her birdie putt, guiding in a right-to-left slider from 12 feet, and the lead is down to one! Par for Shanshan. -5: Thompson (15) -4: Hataoka (16) -3: Feng (16) Thompson digs deep and finds a cracking drive, just when she really needed it! A big boom that gently draws round the corner. Further up the hole, Feng and Hataoka take turn to find the green in regulation. They’ll have looks at birdie from 25 and 12 feet respectively. Thompson’s driving may have fallen out of whack, but she’s not misplaced her ability to read the speed of these greens. She rolls a monster birdie up the 15th to a couple of feet, and makes no mistake with the par saver. Two huge tee shots coming up at the back-to-back par fives, though, and her big stick has been misbehaving since the turn. -5: Thompson (15) -3: Hataoka (15), Feng (15) -2: Khang (16), Saso (15) Ko Jin-young, the 2019 winner of both the ANA and the Evian, cards a 69 and joins Xiyu Lin in the clubhouse lead at +1. Meanwhile on 16, Megan Khang can’t save her par, shoving the putt right, the ball lipping out. Slipping back to -2, the jig may be up for the likeable and relatable 23-year-old from Massachusetts. She responds to events by blowing a raspberry. Saso finds the green at the par-three 15th, but conservatively so. It’s a long two putts for par from the front, with the pin near the back. Thompson, the nerves beginning to jangle, only just gets on as well. Up on 16, Khang comes up a bit short with a chip from the fringe, and she’ll have a six-foot test to save par. First up, her playing partner Saso nearly drains a 30-footer for birdie. While she’s doing that, a huge roar crackles across the Lake Course. Turns out it’s only - only! - Celine Herbin holing out from a bunker on 18 (she signs for a 71 and finishes at +3) but that’s surely going to send Thompson’s mind racing. What’s happened there, then? Is somebody eating into her lead? No - neither Hataoka nor Feng can make their birdie putts at 15 - but she can’t make her par saver, and now that lead is down to two. -5: Thompson (14) -3: Khang (15), Hataoka (15), Feng (15) -2: Saso (14) -1: Yin (15) Thompson is in danger of opening the door here. She hits a heavy chip and is left with a 15-footer for her par. Big putt coming up. Thompson’s lie is not the best, but not the worst either. She’s able to whip hard up the track, the ball bouncing off into the first cut on the left, just in front of the green. That’s a decent effort, all told, though it’s a big up and down coming up. On 15, Hataoka sends her tee shot over the flag, the ball holding the back of the green. She’ll have a look from ten feet at a third consecutive birdie. Her playing partner Feng finds the heart of the green, straight but well short. And on 16, Khang blooters a drive down the middle. What she’d give to take back yesterday’s back nine of 40. She’s shown great spirit to keep fighting after that. Thompson’s tee-box satnav is still on the blink. She takes 3-wood at 14 and sends a huge slice into more thick nonsense down the right. You can’t be driving like this round here, and expect to win the US Open. Then again, this is what Saso was doing yesterday, and she got away with it pretty much every time. Lexi would take more of the same right now. Meanwhile up on 14, Hataoka creams her second to four feet en route to back-to-back birdies. She’s -3. Thompson pulls her very makeable birdie putt at 13 left of the cup. She’ll have to settle for par. Up on 15, Khang whips a delicate chip from the back to three feet and tidies up for par; that’s a fine up and down from a tight spot. On the par-three 15th, Khang is 12 inches short of slam-dunking her tee shot into the cup for an ace. But it bounds past and into the thick stuff at the back. On the par-three 13th, Thompson fires a brave tee shot straight at the flag, and leaves herself an eight-foot uphill birdie putt. All smiles again, after a couple of nervous holes. And Xiyu Lin of China signs for a 67 that gives her the early clubhouse lead at +1. This’ll be the 25-year-old’s best finish in a major by some distance. Before Khang can tidy up on 14, Nasa Hataoka takes aim from the fringe at 13. She sends an oscillating effort into the cup for birdie, and the 22-year-old Japanese star, who already has four top-ten finishes to her name in the majors, gets properly involved in this tournament. Bogey for Lee6, though. Then Khang makes her birdie, and this leaderboard is beginning to look rather interesting. -6: Thompson (12) -3: Khang (14), Feng (13) -2: Hataoka (13), Saso (12) -1: Yin (14) E: Lee6 (13) Thompson elects to putt from the hill at the back of 12. Great decision. She judges the length perfectly, lagging it from 40 feet to 18 inches. She scrambles a nerve-settling par to remain at -6. A two-putt par for Feng on 13. And up on 14, there’s a textbook birdie for Megan Khang, who batters a drive down the middle, then sends her second similarly straight, to a couple of feet. She’ll have that for a birdie and share of second. Thompson takes her sweet time over her second. Not sure this over-thinking is doing her any good. Her ball comes out hot and rolls down the hill at the back of the green. That’s where Feng found herself, ending up with bogey. Speaking of Shanshan, she’s just found the heart of the par-three 13th. Nowhere near the flag, but look what happened to Angel Yin when she failed to find the green. The tension has been cranked up all across the Lake Course. Thompson sends a slice into the thick stuff down the right of 12. This is no time for her driver to start malfunctioning, not on a course as penal as this. Thompson may have stumbled, but those around her are making mistakes too. Feng can’t make her par saver on 12. Yin meanwhile takes three putts on her way to a double at the 144-yard par-three 12th. And while Lexi was making a mess of 11, Saso was bogeying it too, punishment for overhitting a chip from the back of the green and sending her ball toppling down a ridge. The back nine on Sunday at a major championship, ladies and gentlemen! -6: Thompson (11) -3: Feng (12) -2: Khang (13), Saso (11) -1: Yin (13), Hataoka (12) Lee6 (12) Thompson’s lead is suddenly only two. Her monster par putt breaks six feet to the right, then for the first time she prods with great uncertainty at a putt, sending it bobbling to the right of the cup. Her first double of the week, and suddenly this tournament takes on a different complexion. -6: Thompson (11) -4: Feng (11) -3: Yin (12) -2: Khang (13), Saso (11) Feng’s second into 12 bounds over the back. She gives the subsequent chip too much. “Sit! Sit!” The ball does not sit. She’ll have a 12-footer coming back for par. Meanawhile on the par-three 13th, trouble for Yin, whose tee shot tipples down the swale to the left of the green. Shortsided, she tries to stun her chip into the bank, hoping it’ll take all the pace out of it ... but her aim is poor and the ball flies through the green. A long par putt remains. Thompson takes a long time over her chip. She steps away from it a couple of times, clearly in two minds. Unsettled, it’s no huge surprise when she chunks it. Time to regroup, because things can unravel quickly around the Olympic Club. Big putt from the fringe, in more ways than one, coming up. Meanwhile the first-round leader Mel Reid is in with her second 78 of the weekend, and finishes the week at +12. It’s not the greatest of lies. Thompson hacks out hard, but she can’t get the ball to the green. She’s a good 30 yards short. A big up-and-down attempt coming up. Feng launches a 5-iron straight at the flag on 11. That’s a fine shot, and she’ll get a look at birdie from ten feet. She doesn’t make the putt, though, the ball breaking off to the left on its last turn, and the chance to reduce the lead to three is gone. Back on the tee, Thompson pulls her drive into the thick stuff down the left. A slight look of concern washes across her face as she imagines the lie. Thompson misreads the line, the ball breaking well left, but pace is her friend. Perfectly judged, and she’s left with a two-footer to tidy up. Which she does, without fear or fuss. For a player who has often succumbed to nerves from short distances, she’s holding herself together wonderfully. There doesn’t seem a chink in her armour this week, though the back nine at a major is different terrain. A three-putt bogey for Khang on 11. Her putter’s let her down again, for the second time in three holes. She’s -2. Meanwhile a minor mistake by the leader on 10, as Thompson leaves a wedge short of the green from 70 yards. She’s left with a 30-foot putt across a ridge. A long birdie putt for Feng on 10 comes up short. Par. She’s -4. Up on 11, Yin sends an arrow straight at the flag and leaves herself a six-foot look for birdie. But she sends a fidgety effort to the right, and that’s a huge chance to grab a share of second spurned. Thompson sends her second at 9 to ten feet, then looks to have made the birdie putt. The ball inexplicably stays up, teetering on the right-hand edge of the cup. You’d expect it to topple, but it’s not cooperating, and she’s forced to tap in for par. Still, she’s out in 34, which compares favourably to her partners Saso (38) and Ganne (41). Thompson remains four in front at -8. Nasa Hataoka rattles in a right-to-left 20-footer on 9, and that’s her second birdie in three holes. She’s back to -2. She’s going round with Shanshan Feng, who has now grabbed second spot all for herself after sending her approach to four feet and tidying up for birdie. Back down the hole, Thompson splits the fairway with a booming 3-wood. And up on 10, Khang sends her second pin high to eight feet, and knocks in the birdie putt. It only just drops, mind. That needed every single joule of energy. She smiles at her caddy and mimes a heart flutter. Khang is great value. -8: Thompson (8) -4: Feng (9) -3: Yin (10), Khang (10), Saso (8) -2: Hataoka (9) -1: Lee6 (9) Saso chips delicately to a couple of feet. What an up and down! The 19-year-old Filipino has responded excellently to those back-to-back doubles early in her round. For a while it looked as though her head was spinning, but she’s showing real moxie here. Thompson meanwhile leaves her long birdie putt four feet short, and here comes the first test for a player whose flat stick has misbehaved in the past. No problem! In it goes. The gap’s still five. With shots in hand, Lexi can afford to play smart. Saso has to go for the pin at the par-three 8th. It’s tucked away front left, and though she sends it close, her ball bounds into the rough. Shortsided and in the thick stuff, that’ll be one heck of a chip to face. Thompson responds by aiming for the middle of the green. No point looking for trouble. Another birdie for Angel Yin! She steers a right-to-left slider into the cup at 9 from 20 feet, and hits the turn in 31. She grabs a share of second with Feng and Saso at -3. They all should be joined by Yin’s playing partner Megan Khang, but she pulls a short birdie effort and admonishes herself in the theatrical style. Thompson, at the back of 7 in regulation, cradles her long birdie putt to kick-in distance. No need to race heroically at the hole with a five-shot advantage over Feng ... and Saso, who begins to repair all that early damage by draining a 25-footer for her first birdie of the day. -8: Thompson (7) -3: Feng (7), Saso (7) -2: Yin (8), Khang (8) An up-and-down few minutes for the penultimate group. Nasa Hataoka bounces back from double bogey on 6 with birdie at 7. She’s -1, as is Jeongeun Lee6, whose putter has proved problematic all week; three putts on 7 and the 2019 winner is heading in the wrong direction today, two over for her round. The third member of the group, Shanshan Feng, pars both holes in her usual steady style, though nearly drained a long birdie effort on 7. She remains five off at -3. Brooke Henderson is having a good day. Birdies at 5 and now 8 have brought her up to level par for the tournament. How the 2016 PGA champion will rue that inexplicable second round of 78. She’s been on top of her game otherwise, posting 68 on Thursday and 69 yesterday. Meanwhile back on 6, pars for Thompson (-8), Ganne (+2) and Saso (-2). Angel Yin already has a second-place finish at the US Open to her name. The 22-year-old from LA came in behind Jeongeun Lee6 at Charleston in 2019, and she’s bothering the top end of the leaderboard again. Having birdied 1, she sends her second at the short par-four 7th into thick rough down the left. No bother! Out comes the wedge, and she flips onto the green, her ball rattling into the cup at a very satisfying velocity. She joins the group tied for third at -2. A huge smile plays across Thompson’s face as she reacts to that sensational shot. She’s really enjoying herself this week, explaining that she’s been trying to rein in the intensity, to the point of her being more than happy to stop and sign autographs during her round. In goes the birdie putt, and she’s in total control of this US Open right now. Nothing’s over yet, mind you, as the experience of Arnold Palmer, who lost a seven-stroke lead here on the back nine to Billy Casper in the 1966 men’s version, will amply illustrate. -8: Thompson (5) -3: Feng (5) -2: Khang (6), Hataoka (5), Lee6 (5), Saso (5) One of the shots of the week by Lexi Thompson! She’s out of position down the left of 5, in thick rough, a low-hanging branch in the road. She whips out, sending the ball wide right before drawing it back into the front of the green. It bumbles up to a couple of feet, one of those lovely, serene, inevitable golfing journeys. She’ll have that to go five clear of Shanshan Feng. Another wild drive by Ganne, and she’s forced to pitch out sideways from behind a tree at 5. A little backwards, in fact. She had no other shot. Having found the fairway, she arrows her third at the flag, but the ball takes one bounce into thick greenside rough and disappears. One yard longer, and that would have been very close. She holds her head in her hands. It’s all good experience from the university of life, before she goes to actual university at Stanford. Lee6 gets up and down from distance at 5 to limit the damage to bogey. A lovely sand wedge in from 80 yards to ten feet. Her second spot is taken by Shanshan Feng, who has been going along very steadily: 15 pars yesterday, four to start today, and now birdie at 5. Pars all round at 4 in the final group. These are the only players now under par for this tournament: -7: Thompson (4) -3: Feng (5) -2: Khang (5), Hataoka (5), Lee6 (5), Saso (4) To illustrate how difficult the Lake Course is playing today, only 12 players from a field of 66 are in red figures for their round. Only two of that dozen are more than one shot to the good: Celine Herbin (through 7, +1 overall) and last year’s joint runner-up Amy Olsen (through 6, level par overall). This will be Herbin’s best performance in a major by far; the 38-year-old from France’s previous best is a tie for 46th at the PGA. Lee6, currently No2, hooks her tee shot at 5 into big trouble. The thickest rough, from which she barely advances her ball an inch. Take two finds the fairway. Bogey will be a good score from here. Back on 4, Thompson splits the fairway, then arrows her second to 12 feet. She’ll have a great look at birdie, and everything is falling into place for the 2014 Dinah Shore champion here. Megan Khang would be an extremely popular winner. When it was all turning to dust on the back nine yesterday, she battled on with a smile, and that birdie / scrambled par finish, both holes celebrated in carefree style, might stand her in good stead. That’s because, having bogeyed 2, she’s gone on to birdie 3 and now 5, rolling in from 30 feet, to join the group at -2. A huge putt here for Thompson, who gently strokes her 12-footer into the cup to scramble par. All of a sudden, she’s got a four-stroke lead ... over Lee6. Saso makes it back-to-back doubles after pushing her bogey putt wide right. Par for Ganne, stopping the rot to great acclaim. -7: Thompson (3) -3: Lee6 (4) -2: Hataoka (4), Feng (4), Saso (3) Thompson chips her second straight at the flag, but it’s not firm enough and she’s left with a 12-footer for par. Saso’s stuttering start continues as she blasts high out of the sand, but a good 25-feet past the hole. She leaves the long par putt five feet short, too. Ganne meanwhile hangs around patiently as the pair go about their business, having settled herself with a lovely tee shot over the flag to six feet. “That was so bad.” Thompson reacts to her 8-iron into the par-three 3rd, which she hits heavy, her ball ending way short of the green and to the right. She’s not in quite so much trouble as Saso, who dunks her effort into a deep bunker. The leading pair are dragging each other down at the minute. It’s not easy closing out a major championship, is it. Saso’s chip into 2, her fourth, isn’t all that, leaving a 30-foot putt for bogey. She very nearly rolls it in, but the ball sticks on the lip. A double. Ganne’s third from the fringe rolls 12 feet past, and results in a bogey. A double bogey, bogey start for the 17-year-old amateur. The crowd fall sadly silent as their young hero slips to level par. Thompson also drops a stroke, failing to get up and down from the front, her saver stopping a dimple short, just like Ganne’s. -7: Thompson (2) -4: Saso (2) -3: Lee6 (3) -2: Hataoka (3), Feng (3) -1: Stark (4), Khang (4) E: Olson (5), Yin (4), Ganne (2) While the 2nd takes chunks out of the final group, the Swedish amateur Maja Stark rolls in a 15-footer on 4 for another birdie. She’s -1. Then back on 3, Lee6 bounces back from bogey by snaking in a monster putt from off the front of 4. That’s a real momentum shifter! She’s back to -3, and may find herself even closer to the leaders in a couple of minutes’ time. Lexi, in the rough on the other side of the hole, follows Ganne in sending a chaser towards the front of the green. It’s about all either player could do. Finally it’s the turn of Saso, who appears to be in about 22 minds about what to do. She eventually hacks through the thick nonsense, but only manages to advance her ball 50 yards or so, still in the deep rough. She can only hack back out to the fairway, and will need to get up and down from 50 yards for bogey. Saso’s ball is snagged in all sorts of Olympic-standard filth. Halfway up a bank, too. She’s got to decide whether to take her medicine and chip out sideways, or just go for the green with one big gouge. She’s got the power, it might be worth going for it, given there’s no certainty in the sensible option either. A big moment coming up, early doors. She’d take bogey now, if offered, you’d imagine. Ganne meanwhile only just missed the fairway with her drive, but the rough is so lush, she does extremely well to chase her ball up to the fringe. That wasn’t a great putt by Thompson, in truth. A bit off the toe, the ball squirting a couple of crucial millimetres to the right. She sends her drive at 2 into the first cut down the left. Not ideal, but nowhere near as bad as Saso, who sends a huge slice miles right. By all accounts she’s modelled her swing on Rory McIlroy, whose recent major-championship travails open up a world of comedic possibility here. Up on the green, it’s a three-putt bogey for Lee6. Thompson tickles her putt up to the lip, but it stubbornly refuses to drop. No matter, that’s an opening birdie and she’s extended her lead over Saso, who does well to get up and down from the back. Ganne can’t manage it, though, and it’s a double-bogey seven. A nightmare start for the young amateur, who flings her putter onto her bag in her first show of frustration all week. -8: Thompson (1) -6: Saso (1) -3: Lee6 (1) -2: Hataoka (1), Feng (1) -1: Ganne (1) Saso lays up at 1, only to send her wedge over the back of the green. Ganne - who doesn’t hang about, playing at the sort of speed that would make Brooks look like Bryson - clips what seems a perfectly judged fourth towards the flag, but it keeps on rolling and topples off alongside Saso. “Aw come on!” shouts someone in the crowd. The gallery has had her back all week, and they’re not about to abandon the effervescent amateur now. Ganne has been ice-cool all week, but the nerves may have finally caught up with her. She’s forced to take her medicine and chip back out onto the 1st fairway, then slices her third into the gallery down the right. It’s a complete contrast to the way Thompson is playing the hole: she takes advantage of her big drive by lashing a long iron straight at the flag, the ball rolling serenely to ten feet or so, setting up an eagle chance. As statements of intent go, that’s a doozy. The putter often goes cold on Thompson; if she makes this, she might decide that it’s going to be her day. Birdie for Nasa Hataoka on the 1st. Pars for Shanshan Feng and Jeongeun Lee6, the latter knocking in a six-foot saver that should give her succour after yesterday’s putting woes. The flat stick has been letting the 2019 winner down this week. Here comes the marquee grouping! The 17-year-old amateur Megha Ganne is up first. A slightly nervous smile turns into a broad one as the gallery welcome her with a huge cheer. She was a bit wayward off the tee yesterday, and that continues here as she sends her drive well right. Yuka Saso is up next. She was also all over the shop with the big stick yesterday, but her first drive splits the fairway. Finally it’s the leader Lexi Thompson. She’s not won on Tour for nearly two years, so some nerves would be understandable, but she obliterates one down the track. That’s gone miles. Everyone’s out, then. This is on! Megan Khang needs a fast start today. She was right up there yesterday afternoon, until four consecutive bogeys between 13 and 16 sent her crashing down the leaderboard. Her spirit didn’t break, though, and she celebrated birdie at 17 with a smile and an ironic celebration, then did the same, with added laughter, upon draining a par saver on the last. The only way to respond to a nightmare back nine, as she came home in 40. She immediately sets up a straight 15-foot birdie chance this morning, but pulls it wide left. So much for springing out of the blocks. She remains at -1. In just about any other year - one without the sensational antics of Megha Ganne - we’d all be talking about Maja Stark. The 21-year-old amateur from Sweden has been hovering on the periphery this week, posting rounds of 71, 70 and 73. She’s birdied 1 this morning, too, and currently stands at level par for the tournament. As things stand, she’s tied for eighth place. Normally this is nosebleed territory for an amateur, but Stark has been there, done that: she tied for 13th on debut last year. Before the leading contenders take to the stage, word of the first-round leader Mel Reid. A 67 on Thursday sparked talk of a possible maiden major for the 33-year-old from Derby. She looked focused, bang in the zone, a study in determination. But all that intensity must have been mentally exhausting. A disappointing 73 on Friday, then a strange 78 yesterday that variously featured a shank, a whiffed chip and a hole-out from 100 yards for eagle. Out of contention, she’s already carded a couple of bogeys today, at 2 and 4, and has slipped down to +7. But when it all comes down, this week should give her plenty of confidence going forward. As a late bloomer in the majors, compared to your Lexis, Inbees and Lydias, she’s trending in the right direction. Glory soon? The tee times for the final groups at the business end of this US Open, then. All BST. 5.59pm: Kim Hyo-joo, Maja Stark (a), Brooke Henderson 6.11pm: Megan Khang, Inbee Park, Angel Yin 6.23pm: Jeongeun Lee6, Shanshan Feng, Nasa Hataoka 6.35pm: Lexi Thompson, Yuka Saso, Megha Ganne (a) It almost defies belief that Lexi Thompson has only one major title to her name. When she won the Kraft Nabisco in 2014 at 19, it was assumed that she’d start racking up the slams with Sorenstamian regularity. But for one reason and another, it’s never quite happened. Three second places in the majors, three thirds, 16 top-ten finishes. It’s about that time, and yesterday’s flawless 66 was carpe-diem stuff. This is the first time she’s led the US Open after any round, a stat that might not say much about most 26-year-olds, but Thompson first played in this tournament in 2007 at the precocious age of 12. This is her 15th consecutive appearance. Is she finally going to land major number two? Yuka Saso is best placed to stop her. The powerful Filipino spent most of yesterday’s round driving like Seve, but no matter, thanks to her ability to gouge back into position, as though the penal Olympic Club rough wasn’t there, and her scrambling skills around the greens; she chips a bit like Seve, too. If she wins today, she’ll join Inbee Park as the only teenage winner of the US Open. Park won in 2008 at 19 years, 11 months and 17 days; that’s Saso’s exact age today. Some things seem written. Or could Megha Ganne become only the second amateur to win the US Open, matching the feat of Catherine Lacoste in 1967? The 17-year-old from New Jersey received vociferous support from the gallery yesterday, at one point getting to within a shot of the lead. When asked for her secret, she smiled: “I figure why not make it fun?” She’s the real deal. Some big names are lurking, including 2019 champion Jeongeun Lee6, 2012 PGA winner Shanshan Feng, major champs in waiting Nasa Hataoka and Megan Khang, and seven-time major winner Inbee Park. Should Thompson and Saso hit their stride, it will be a two-woman race, but anything can happen at Olympic Club, and it can happen to the best of them: just ask Arnold Palmer, who lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper in the 1966 men’s version. The final round of the 76th US Women’s Open is very much on. Our coverage begins at 6pm BST. -7: Lexi Thompson -6: Yuka Saso -3: Megha Ganne, Jeongeun Lee6 -2: Shanshan Feng -1: Nasa Hataoka, Megan Khang E: Inbee Park","charCount":"40645","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/scottmurray\">Scott Murray</a>"},{"headline":"Biden to affirm US-UK special relationship at G7 meeting with Johnson ","standfirst":"<p>President also expected to discuss post-Brexit difficulties in Northern Ireland with the prime minister</p>","trailText":"President also expected to discuss post-Brexit difficulties in Northern Ireland with the prime minister","byline":"Edna Mohamed","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f9f1d2fea9fe37796afb6d72fbee2090125ba66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f9f1d2fea9fe37796afb6d72fbee2090125ba66/0_299_5836_3501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are making their first foreign trip as the presidential couple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Joe Biden has issued a statement pledging to affirm his “special relationship” with Britain when he meets Boris Johnson at this week’s G7 summit in the UK and discuss matters including the impasse in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>In an article for the Washington Post published on Sunday before his first foreign travel trip as president, Biden wrote: “In the United Kingdom, after meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to affirm the special relationship between our nations, I will participate in the G7 summit.</p> <p>“This group of leading democracies and economies has not met in person in two years due to the coronavirus.

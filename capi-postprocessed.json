Werner chests down, just by the edge of the six-yard box. He turns, and shanks a dismal effort wide right.

Havertz races after it, though a huge gap in the City defence caused by Werner’s decoy run to the left. Ederson comes to the edge of the box, but Havertz rounds him on the left and rolls into an empty net!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"877a8e9524eab8c11d46168a933fcba1ff5c1f72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/877a8e9524eab8c11d46168a933fcba1ff5c1f72/0_0_4552_3034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kai Havertz of Chelsea scores.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kai Havertz of Chelsea scores.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34e56a25a0872df8b4639640fca9f10a50dd0bcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34e56a25a0872df8b4639640fca9f10a50dd0bcd/0_0_1923_1411/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Havertz celebrates scoring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"734\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Havertz celebrates scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Coelho/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T19:56:01.141Z\">at 8.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b298c88f086d71cc15ea9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T19:42:07.867Z\">8.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>40 min: </strong>Chilwell crosses deep from the left.

He nearly manages it, but James battles well to fend him off. City come again, immediately, De Bruyne slipping a pass down the left channel for Foden, who is suddenly free in the box! But only for a split second. Foden looks to pass across Mendy and into the bottom right, but his shot is blocked by an absurdly good last-ditch challenge by Rudiger, whose telescopic leg balloons the ball into the arms of his keeper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fec1545fd195faf65f34ba31cce3e8ac10f6893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fec1545fd195faf65f34ba31cce3e8ac10f6893/0_0_2052_1389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City’s Phil Foden is denied by Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City’s Phil Foden is denied by Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manu Fernández/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T19:33:10.124Z\">at 8.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b295618f086d71cc15ea7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T19:27:32.438Z\">8.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>26 min:</strong> James curls in.

A free kick in a dangerous position out on the right.

For your future reference, I think a much better and more idiomatic translation into Portuguese would be ‘Temos jogo!’ (We’ve got a game!).”</p> <p>Meanwhile your memories of the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final have been flooding in, in their twos. “I was there!” writes Matthew Holt. “Pat Nevin put in about four unplayable crosses for our goals, then in the last five mins City started scoring and were only stopped by the final whistle. A repeat today please, with the ghost of Wee Pat putting in a few for Werner to finish off!”</p> <p>Our resident Fife, Angus and Perth &amp; Kinross correspondent Simon McMahon adds: “Five Scots in the Chelsea team for that Full Members’ Cup Final, including of course Johnny Marr lookalike Pat Nevin, whose autobiography, The Accidental Footballer, is excellent by the way. Billy McNeill managing City too. Billy Gilmour, the only Scottish representative on the bench for Chelsea tonight, could have a Champions League winners medal at age 19.

Nothing comes of the resulting set piece, but Gundogan has to be careful seeing he’s on a yellow. 53 min: Now it’s Dias’s turn to execute a world-class slide, as he pokes the ball away from Werner, who was threatening to break free down the right, chasing after James’ long pass. 52 min: De Bruyne lengthens his stride and begins to look very dangerous as he sashays down the inside-left channel. But just as he shapes to shoot, Kante comes sliding in from behind and hooks away sensationally. As good a tackle as you’ll see. 51 min: Chelsea look fairly comfortable at the moment. City haven’t created anything of note since the restart. Guardiola may be considering a change. 49 min: City knock it around but Chelsea hold their shape and there’s no way through. Eventually Walker swings in from the right but it’s an easy claim for Mendy, with nobody in sky blue sniffing around. Penny for the thoughts of Sergio Aguero. 48 min: In fact De Bruyne dummies it and leaves Foden to take instead. Foden can’t beat first man Kante, and what a waste that is. 47 min: Sterling busies himself down the left and is gently tugged by James. All’s fair in love and war, so down he goes. Free kick. De Bruyne to take. Chelsea get the second half underway. A reminder that if the teams are level after 90 minutes, it’s 30 minutes of extra time and possibly penalties. There have been no half-time changes, but there could be plenty to come: each team are allowed to make five subs, with a sixth permissible if we go to extra time. Half-time entertainment. As things stand, it’s one heck of a day for west London. Paul Doyle was at Wembley to see Brentford finally make it to the promised land of the Premier League. Here’s his take on an excellent performance from the Bees. City look a little stunned as they make their way down the tunnel, Pep having very quickly disappeared down it beforehand. Chelsea stroll off, ten feet tall. A gorgeous Kai Havertz finish is the difference; Chelsea are 45 minutes away from their second European Cup! City have some thinking to do. 45 min +1: Kante chips in cutely from the right. Werner chests down, just by the edge of the six-yard box. He turns, and shanks a dismal effort wide right. He’s been involved constantly since the get-go, impressing in every aspect other than his shooting. A big caveat admittedly, but he’s an undoubted presence up front. 45 min: Chelsea won’t want to hear the half-time whistle, but it’ll be coming in three minutes time. On the touchline, Pep looks extremely concerned. 44 min: That’s a lovely goal. Ederson had come racing out of his box, and the ball hit his arm, although he was trying to withdraw it. Havertz could also have gone over, in a cynical attempt to get the keeper sent off. So it could have been worse for City. But here we are. Silva screams at his team-mates to pick up their heads, while the Dragao erupts! Chelsea ping it around patiently ... then spring forward! Mendy passes wide left to Chilwell, who finds Mount infield. Mount spins and plays a first-time ball down the inside-left channel. Havertz races after it, though a huge gap in the City defence caused by Werner’s decoy run to the left. Ederson comes to the edge of the box, but Havertz rounds him on the left and rolls into an empty net! 40 min: Chilwell crosses deep from the left. Werner tries to cushion the ball into the path of Havertz, but the two Chelsea forwards are too close to each other, and a baroque mess ensues. Chelsea have attacked well; they’ve just been unable to find that final ball. 39 min: Poor old Silva can’t continue. He’s close to tears as he motions to the bench, then trudges off, but it doesn’t stop him making a special beeline towards his replacement Christensen, wishing him all the best. 37 min: City have enjoyed 58 percent of possession so far. No huge surprises here. Chelsea are quite happy to wait for a chance to counter, and here they come, snaffling the ball, Kante gliding upfield with options either side. He looks for Havertz down the inside-right, Zinchenko recovering and blocking. That’s a fine last-ditch tackle, though Kante should perhaps have used one of his options to the left instead. 36 min: Silva isn’t happy. It’s not his shoulder; it’s a pull in the groin. He’s feeling his Special Area gingerly, and wincing quite a lot. He’s going to continue for now, though Chelsea have sent Andreas Christensen and Kurt Zouma out to warm up, just in case. 34 min: Gundogan high-kicks Mount to the floor as Chelsea build an attack from deep. VAR has a look at a possible red-card offence, but it’s just a yellow for a kick on the knee. 32 min: Now it’s Chelsea’s turn to take a little sting out of the game with some sterile stuff at the back. After that flurry of City action, they need the breather. 31 min: Walker turns on the jets and speeds past Chilwell down the right. He almost literally sends Chilwell spinning like a top in his slipstream. What determination ... and what a cross he fizzes along the face of the six-yard box. Mahrez is inches away from sliding to connect with his toe. If he hadn’t cut his toenails last night, it was 1-0. 29 min: After a slow start, it’s safe to say City have woken up. They’re beginning to get a lot of joy down their left flank. 27 min: Sterling turns on the burners and tries to make his way past James on the outside. He nearly manages it, but James battles well to fend him off. City come again, immediately, De Bruyne slipping a pass down the left channel for Foden, who is suddenly free in the box! But only for a split second. Foden looks to pass across Mendy and into the bottom right, but his shot is blocked by an absurdly good last-ditch challenge by Rudiger, whose telescopic leg balloons the ball into the arms of his keeper. 26 min: James curls in. City clear, then swarm upfield. In a matter of milliseconds, the ball’s been shuttled back to the feet of Mendy. For all the open, fun play, neither keeper has had a serious save to make yet. 25 min: Chelsea buzz around, and eventually a frustrated Dias comes out to bowl Kante to the ground. A free kick in a dangerous position out on the right. They load the box. “I can’t but root for Thiago Silva,” begins Kári Tulinius. “While I’ve probably watched him play hundreds of matches during his long career, the image of him that always comes to mind is of him in the stands at the 2014 World Cup semi-final against Germany, helplessly watching as his Brazilian team mates gave a masterclass in inept defending. I don’t think I’ve stopped feeling sorry for him since. I hope he gets a gold medal tonight.” 23 min: Havertz finds a little space up the other end and rolls wide to the lively Chilwell, whose cross isn’t up to much. But Chelsea quickly come again, James crossing from the right, Havertz winding his neck back in the hope of heading home. Stones eyebrows clear, just in time. 21 min: So having said that, here’s some space for De Bruyne down the left, sent away by Sterling. De Bruyne reaches the byline and forces a corner, but turns out he went a little early and the flag goes up for offside. “Nearly 20 minutes gone, and I don’t think Werner’s been caught offside yet? No one saw that coming.” Matt Dony, ladies and gentlemen. He’s here all week. Try the Francesinha. 19 min: De Bruyne and Sterling combine crisply down the left, but there’s little space in which to create, and Azpilicueta is over quickly to blooter clear. A couple of City frowns already, as they struggle to make things happen in the Chelsea final third. 17 min: Both teams are pressing manically. A lot of misplaced passes as a result. A lot of highly decent first-time ones, too, though, and Chilwell finds Mount down the left. Werner is nearly sent clear with a slide down the channel, but he cuts back for Chilwell, who curls long to the far post. Kante, of all people, arrives to head high and wide. Chelsea have been excellent in these opening exchanges. 15 min: Werner could easily have had a couple of goals already, and here he is winning a corner, troubling Stones down the left and flashing towards the bottom left. The ball’s deflected out for a corner, from which ... Ederson claims and City break! De Bruyne tries to dribble into the box from the right but is stopped by Kante. This is wonderfully open, with both teams going for it. 14 min: Chelsea come at City again, Mount nicking the ball off Mahrez, Chilwell bombing down the inside-left channel. He cuts back for Werner, who tries to pass first time into the bottom left. Ederson reads him and saves. 12 min: Stones errs again, struggling to keep his balance while Werner attacks him down the right. The City defender does just about enough to keep Werner from finding the killer pass infield, but this is a shaky start by Stones. Werner, that absurd miss apart, has looked extremely lively. 10 min: Now it’s Chelsea’s turn to launch long. Stones fluffs his clearance, allowing Havertz to slide down the left and pull back for Werner, who should score from six yards, but takes a fresh-air swipe. The act of a confidence-free player. City go up the other end, countering through Sterling, but his ball inside is whipped clear by Rudiger. Good fun, this! 8 min: Ederson plays a long pass down the middle, and releases Sterling. Simple as that! Sterling can’t bring it down cleanly, allowing James, in pursuit, to block out for a corner. Had Sterling taken that in his stride, in the Suarez-versus-Newcastle style, he was in on goal. Easier said than done. Nothing comes from the corner. 7 min: Walker gets the better of Silva down the right, but the play’s pulled back for a foul. A light tug on the Brazilian defender’s shoulder. Silva holds it while grimacing in pain, but is good to continue right now. There didn’t seem too much in that, but there we are. 5 min: The start’s been a bit hectic for City’s liking, so they slow it down with some sterile possession across the back. A few early nerves need settling. 4 min: More space for Werner down the right. He scampers to the byline and pulls back for Havertz, who can’t control properly, and the ball squirts into the hands of Ederson. Chelsea will be enthused by those two early Werner bursts. 3 min: Chelsea gather themselves and launch the first attacking sortie of the evening, Werner grooving his way down the right. Stones shuts the door. 1 min: A slightly nervous start by Chelsea as they play the ball across their back line in not-particularly-convincing fashion, City pressing hard. They get away with it. Both sets of fans giving it plenty. City kick off ... but only after the knee is taken. There’s no room for racism. Challenge it. Report it. Change it. Kick it out. A smattering of boos, but they’re drowned out by a much louder wave of applause. Here come the teams! Bedlam at the Dragao, despite the limited capacity. One hell of a reception. City fans are so excited they don’t bother booing the official Uefa Champions League anthem that much. Captains Kevin De Bruyne and Cesar Azpilicueta exchange pennants. Coins are tossed, fists bumped. We’ll be off in a minute. Temos jogo! “Vamos jogar is better,” argues Tim Stappard. Another dip into the pre-match postbag. “What a day to be a Fulham supporter: Brentford in the play-off final and Chelsea in the Champions League final,” begins Richard Hirst. “Much as I grieve at Brentford being a division above Fulham, they probably deserve it after all their near misses. And my goddaughter and family are Brentford supporters, so love trumps local rivalry. But no such dispensation for Chelsea - come on City!” Gary Byrne asks the big question: “Is John Terry in the stadium, full kit on?” And here’s Tim Daly: “Scott Carson is making his second appearance as a substitute keeper in a Champions League final, sixteen years on from a famous night in Istanbul.” Good spot, that. Should City win, Carson will beat the 14-year gap between brief goalkeeping appearances made by Jimmy Rimmer, who was reserve keeper for Manchester United against Benfica in 1968, then played the first nine minutes for Aston Villa against Bayern Munich in 1982 before his shoulder gave way, young Nigel Spink coming on to become the unlikely hero. If we see third-choice Carson in action tonight, it’ll be one hell of a story, one way or the other. The pre-match thoughts of a slightly pensive Pep Guardiola ... “To have a chance to win the game, you have to attack. Of course you have to defend, we need everyone. I am sure the second half will be very different than the beginning. Chelsea play five in the back, we need specific players in that area.” ... and a relaxed, smiling Thomas Tuchel, both men talking to BT Sport. “We had some final words, but everything is said now. We have to do it, they know it, and it’s good that they know it, because it’s their quality, their team effort that can decide this match on our side. We have gone for a little bit of height, Timo and Kai have a good feeling for each other. It is a tough choice to leave Christian Pulisic out, but we need 15 or 16 today to finish this game, hopefully in a positive way. I hope we can start strong, but finish even stronger. It’s a huge opponent, a big game in Europe, and we are up for it.” A peek inside the Chelsea dressing room. City are the designated home side, but both teams will be able to play in their first-choice colours. As in the Premier League, it’s been decided there’s no clash between the sky blue of City and Chelsea’s royal hue. Petr Cech, Chelsea’s technical advisor and hero of 2012, talks to BT Sport, and appears up for this. “The last step is usually the hardest one. There is a big chance the game will go to penalties. I hope the team is ready and confident that we will win it. Manchester City are a tough team to beat. It will be an entertaining game, even though you expect it to be a tactical game.” A dip into the pre-match postbag. We’ll get to tonight’s match in good time, but first thing’s first. “As an English translator, resident in Lisbon for many years, I feel I must help with your translation of ‘It’s on’,” begins John Elliott, who may or may not have twigged that I don’t speak a word of Portuguese and was wholly reliant on Google Translate. “‘Ligado’ is ‘on’ in the sense of ‘electrically’ on or off. For your future reference, I think a much better and more idiomatic translation into Portuguese would be ‘Temos jogo!’ (We’ve got a game!).” Meanwhile your memories of the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final have been flooding in, in their twos. “I was there!” writes Matthew Holt. “Pat Nevin put in about four unplayable crosses for our goals, then in the last five mins City started scoring and were only stopped by the final whistle. A repeat today please, with the ghost of Wee Pat putting in a few for Werner to finish off!” Our resident Fife, Angus and Perth &amp; Kinross correspondent Simon McMahon adds: “Five Scots in the Chelsea team for that Full Members’ Cup Final, including of course Johnny Marr lookalike Pat Nevin, whose autobiography, The Accidental Footballer, is excellent by the way. Billy McNeill managing City too. Billy Gilmour, the only Scottish representative on the bench for Chelsea tonight, could have a Champions League winners medal at age 19. Doubt Nevin would swap his Full Members gong though.” Johnny Marr is a City fan, of course. I am The Weaver. Everyone thought Pep had given up tinkering, which hasn’t always been a successful pastime for him in this competition, but there’s a big surprise: a very attacking line-up with no holding player. Neither Fernandinho nor Rodri starts, which suggests Pep is expecting his side to enjoy the lion’s share of possession. That’s a brave call, as he’ll have to field a fair few questions should this go wrong. Ilkay Gundogan is fit after limping out of training yesterday, Raheem Sterling starts, Oleksandr Zinchenko gets the nod at left-back, and if Sergio Aguero is to be the epochal hero again, he’ll need to come on and do it as a sub. Another 94th-minute winner, anyone? Chelsea’s selection is comparatively understated. N’Golo Kante and Edouard Mendy are fit to play. Ben Chilwell is picked ahead of Marcos Alonso, while Timo Werner and Kai Havertz are the ones stationed up front alongside Mason Mount. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Stones, Zinchenko, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Mahrez, Sterling, Foden. Subs: Steffen, Carson, Ake, Jesus, Aguero, Laporte, Rodrigo, Torres, Mendy, Fernandinho, Cancelo, Garcia. Chelsea: Mendy, James, Thiago Silva, Rudiger, Azpilicueta, Kante, Jorginho, Chilwell, Mount, Havertz, Werner. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Alonso, Christensen, Pulisic, Caballero, Zouma, Kovacic, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Ziyech, Gilmour, Emerson Palmieri. Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (Valencia). Manchester City and Chelsea have previously met in two other finals. There was the absurdity of the 2019 League Cup final, which City won on penalties but is already only remembered for the preposterous row between Maurizio Sarri and Kepa, who refused to come off. But never mind that. The big one was the 1986 Full Members’ Cup final, a nine-goal thriller that may never be topped in the eyes of a certain generation. Chelsea and City have come a long way since, but some things remain golden, no matter what. As for the managers themselves ... well, we all remember Thomas Tuchel sitting on the PSG icebox last year, his leg all bound up like the farmer in Withnail &amp; I. He’s zero for one, though by making it back immediately with Chelsea, he becomes the first man to take different clubs to the final in successive seasons. Pep Guardiola meanwhile is making his third appearance as a boss at the final, having won the thing with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011. If he makes it a hat-trick of wins today, he’ll become only the sixth coach in history to win the European Cup with two different clubs, getting his name on an elite list that so far includes Ernst Happel (Feyenoord 1970, Hamburg 1983), Ottmar Hitzfeld (Borussia Dortmund 1997, Bayern Munich 2001), José Mourinho (Porto 2004, Internazionale 2010), Jupp Heynckes (Real Madrid 1998, Bayern 2013) and Carlo Ancelotti (AC Milan 2003 and 2007, Real Madrid 2014). Throw in a couple of appearances as a player, winning in 1992 and losing in 1994 with Barca, and that’s quite the relationship with Europe’s showpiece event. This is virgin territory for nearly everyone involved (if you ignore the managers, that is). Only one member of each squad has previously played in a Champions League final, and neither has particularly happy memories. İlkay Gündoğan turned out for Borussia Dortmund in 2013, scoring from the penalty spot in their 2-1 defeat by Bayern Munich. Thiago Silva meanwhile was captain of the Paris Saint-Germain team that lost to the very same Bavarian party-poopers last year. Mateo Kovačić was there for Real Madrid in 2017 and 2018, but only looking on as an unused substitute. Chelsea fans are also enjoying their big day out. Here’s one getting the top of his head coloured in. We’re assuming, given the ITV ident craze sweeping Porto, he asked for the LWT ribbon, only to be told the artist had no orange paint. No matter: Stamford the Lion will offer plenty of protection from those harmful UV rays, because it’s been a lovely warm and gloriously sunny day in Porto. Perfect conditions for the biggest game on the calendar. Fans of both teams have been out on the Super Bock. Here’s the best-dressed one. Apt, too. Granada were prime movers in the popularisation of the European Cup, their cameras on hand to transmit the exploits of the Busby Babes, Old Trafford being just down the road. The second leg of the 1957 semi between United and Real Madrid was the first to be transmitted live in its entirety on the all-new ITV, though only in the Granada region.

That’s when Melbourne’s St Vincent’s hospital announced that its clinical psychologist, Dr Margaret Ross, would oversee Australia’s first psychedelic trial, using psilocybin – the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms – to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/12/psychedelic-mental-illness-treatment-mdma-magic-mushrooms-expected-to-be-approved\">treat people in palliative care</a>.</p> <p>“Until that time, people had been concerned for their professional standing, but suddenly it had become legitimised and destigmatised,” Williams says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/13/it-blew-my-mind-can-psychedelic-drugs-cure-addiction-depression\">‘The ketamine blew my mind’: can psychedelics cure addiction and depression?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Interested healthcare professionals tended to fall into two categories: those sympathetic to psychedelic psychotherapy and have been waiting for legislation to catch up, and those medical “elders”, such as psychiatrists, who have become recently convinced.</p> <p>“There’s a cohort of psychiatrists and psychologists who have been frustrated by the demonstrable lack of positive outcomes for a certain proportion of the patients,” he says. “They’ve come to the conclusion that the current drugs – antidepressants and mood stabilisers and so forth – just don’t work for everybody.”</p> <p>So far, all Australia’s psychedelic trials involve psilocybin or MDMA, but the training needs for each are very different. With a “classic psychedelic” such as psilocybin – which lends itself to the treatment of addiction, depression and anxiety and mood disorders – the participant has a very internal experience, so the therapist may provide minimal intervention, leaving the main work to follow-up sessions. Psilocybin has been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6726261/\">researched in the treatment of palliative care patients</a> suffering existential distress – its properties have been known to produce profound alterations in thought and perception and, in some cases, “ego dissolution and mystical-type experiences”.</p> <p>A dose of MDMA – regarded as more useful in the treatment of PTSD – tends to enhance trust and increase communication, so a therapist can explore traumatic memories with the participant while they are in their altered state.</p> <p>The MDMA trial that Townsend has been recruited for – along with 24 other Melbourne-based practitioners – is overseen by principal investigator Dr Paul Liknaitzky, who heads up the the clinical psychedelic research lab at Monash University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"923ca71a35b9bc34f53b56e27634f490ec25c6c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/923ca71a35b9bc34f53b56e27634f490ec25c6c1/198_0_5066_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Pant is a psychologist who has signed up to a Monash University research trial which coaches the people involved in using psychedelics as part of their therapy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Pant is a psychologist who has signed up to a Monash University research trial which coaches the people involved in using psychedelics as part of their therapy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bea Maz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Liknaitzky’s estimation, the government’s $15m is enough to fund about six clinical trials.

Before training in psychotherapy, Pant worked in theatre, something she thinks puts her in good stead for immersing herself in people’s alternative realities.

Otherwise there’s a risk of it just being a great experience you had once.”<br></p> <p>David Spektor, another recruit, has been a clinical psychologist for 17 years. He may have a more traditional background than Pant and Townsend – he’s never held retreats or sustained sessions – but as someone trained in intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy focused on helping people build their capacity to tolerate their emotions, he’s curious about the way in which MDMA is thought to open up emotional processing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f415db910cf9827d3d22e250ab53f6ff5f2cb537\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f415db910cf9827d3d22e250ab53f6ff5f2cb537/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr David Spektor take part in the research trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr David Spektor take part in the research trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I’m a bit sceptical of it being that simple, but what better way to learn firsthand than to be part of this training?” he says. “I’m not a typically spiritual person, but it’s undeniable that people experience things that are very interesting.

I sort of equate it to when you want to return something you’ve bought online, they should make that process as easy as possible.” “I just think in general people are going to book more if they have that certainty, that should something like this come up at the last minute, they’re not going to be messed around.” Packett luckily had an understanding host, and was able to exchange dates to November, but she never got a firm answer on if she could have gotten a refund. “We would have liked a refund, we were just over it and didn’t want to risk coming again. But we’ve just rebooked everything for November, it was easier than getting a refund.” Derek Nolan, Airbnb’s head of public policy for Australia and New Zealand, said most hosts do offer flexible cancellation policies. “For our guest community, hosts recognise that they are seeking flexibility at these uncertain times, and now almost two-thirds of active listings offer a moderate or flexible cancellation policy.” “And with our flexible cancellation policy search filter, guests search for listings that offer free cancellation until 24 hours before check-in, avoiding any strict cancellation policy listings from their search results entirely. Guests can view their host’s cancellation policy prior to booking. “We want to thank our community for continuing to do their part to combat Covid-19. Our message has been consistent and clear: everyone must closely follow government advice and strictly adhere to the rules.” Jodi Bird, a travel expert at consumer advocacy group Choice, said the change in policy was within the company’s “rights”. “It would be a positive development for the travel industry if a high-profile booking site like Airbnb set a higher standard for refunds, but Airbnb are within their rights not to extend their extenuating circumstances policy to unforeseeable travel bans. “When people are booking travel on Airbnb, we recommend they check the ‘Only show stays that offer free cancellation’ filter.” Packett is not certain her reorganised trip for November will go ahead, but says she is hopeful things will have stabilised by then. “We’re not confident it will happen, we’re hoping more people will be vaccinated, so we’ve just got to be hopeful.”","charCount":"3704","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/mostafa-rachwani-\">Mostafa Rachwani</a>"},{"headline":"Recycling textile waste: ‘A solution exists, we can’t go backwards’","standfirst":"<p>A world-first commercial plant designed to turn fabric into raw materials will also address the vast amounts of fast fashion heading for landfill</p>","trailText":"A world-first commercial plant designed to turn fabric into raw materials will also address the vast amounts of fast fashion heading for landfill","byline":"Ben Smee","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19fd3df89b696470646bf6a6da4002e89b755474\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19fd3df89b696470646bf6a6da4002e89b755474/0_0_5880_4202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Founders of textile recycling outfit BlockTexx Adrian Jones and Graham Ross\" width=\"1000\" height=\"715\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Founders of textile recycling outfit BlockTexx Adrian Jones and Graham Ross: ‘We’ve got the opportunity to do something.

The problem is exacerbated by the lack of an effective recycling process.

Your own private beach and views from your porch to water as far as you can see – all for $5,000. That is not a misprint. It was the price Don Murphy, 76, recently paid for a waterfront house on the shores of Menindee Lake in the hamlet of Sunset Strip, more than 100km east of Broken Hill in the New South Wales outback. The house came with a car, furniture and utensils, but there are a few catches. “It’s a very old house,” Murphy says. “A big tree fell down and wrecked half the roof.” After the previous owner died, their family was happy to get rid of it, Murphy says. He’s had to take five trailer loads to the tip. The car in the garage went to the tip too. Now he’s wondering how to get 10-metre-long roofing materials from Broken Hill. Also, the lake is not always there. The Menindee lakes, which are an important sacred site for the Baaka people who have lived there for over 40,000 years, hold three and a half times the volume of Sydney Harbour when full, and cover 475 sq km. But the lakes are ephemeral and depend on flows down the Baaka-Darling river from hundreds of kilometres away. Menindee, population 551, is a seven-hour drive from the nearest capital city, Adelaide, much of it along outback dirt roads. The nearest airport is 110km away at Broken Hill. It’s a one-pub town that depends on the Flying Doctor service, one nurse and the Rural Fire Service to deliver healthcare. Sunset Strip, 20km out of town on the edge of the largest lake, feels a bit like Palm Springs meets a shanty town, though unlike Palm Springs, famous for its mid-century buildings, no architect ever set foot there. Developed in the 1950s and 60s as the playground for the mine managers and executives from BHP’s mines at Broken Hill, it sprang up along the lake shore as a respite from the dust and heat of the famous mining town. But it was in those years that the lakes were converted to a water storage, a decision that now has profound implications for the town – and for Murphy’s waterfront idyll. They were linked to the river and each other by building gates and channels. In 2015 and 2017 the NSW government and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority decided to empty the lakes and send the water to South Australia, ahead of forecast dry seasons, to avoid losing water to evaporation in the hot, dry climate of Menindee. That meant the Menindee lakes were empty through one of the worst droughts NSW has seen. And it left Menindee without the tourist dollars that streams of grey nomads bring when they travel to see the miraculous lakes. Now 60% full after recent rain, the lakes are again drawing the visitors. Migratory birds are returning, eagles fly overhead and golden perch, which spend their infancy in the lakes, are spawning. But Menindee’s place on the tourist trail is fragile, just as Murphy’s waterfront view is. A plan to shrink the lake system as a more permanent water saving arrangement is now under review. Alternative plans include building up the northern lakes and leaving the southern Menindee and Cawndilla lakes empty more often. That would leave Sunset Strip and its waterfront high and dry. Sunset Strip property prices have crashed as a result of the management of the lake in recent years. “It won’t last long. They are already starting to drain it,” Murphy says, referring to moves this week to send about 30m litres of water, about 4% of the lake volume, south. “They will drain them for sure, there’s no risk of that.” His plan is to renovate “a little bit at a time” and enjoy the lake view while it lasts.","charCount":"3554","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/anne-davies\">Anne Davies</a>"},{"headline":"New Zealand offer to resettle Australia’s offshore refugees still active as US deal nears end ","standfirst":"<p>Jacinda Ardern’s office confirms refugee offer has not changed, but does not say if deal is on bilateral talks agenda </p>","trailText":"Jacinda Ardern’s office confirms refugee offer has not changed, but does not say if deal is on bilateral talks agenda ","byline":"Tess McClure and Ben Doherty","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31f29ada087f2004625cff309882608f1d91654b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31f29ada087f2004625cff309882608f1d91654b/0_130_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern will meet on Sunday and Monday in Queenstown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern will meet on Sunday and Monday in Queenstown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loren Elliott/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>New Zealand’s offer to resettle refugees from Australia’s offshore immigration detention system remains on the table, and the imminent end of Australia’s long-running US refugee swap could bring it under more urgent consideration from Australia.</p> <p>The office of Jacinda Ardern confirmed to the Guardian that her country’s position had not changed – the longstanding offer to accept 150 refugees from Australia’s offshore islands each year still stood – but declined to confirm whether it was on the agenda for the New Zealand prime minister’s meeting with her Australian counterpart on Sunday. “We don’t discuss the content of bilaterals before they take place.”</p> <p>Ardern and Scott Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/28/scott-morrison-jacinda-ardern-talks-australia-new-zealand-china-and-deportations-policy\">will meet on Sunday and Monday</a> in Queenstown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/28/scott-morrison-jacinda-ardern-talks-australia-new-zealand-china-and-deportations-policy\">China and deportations policy likely to overshadow Morrison-Ardern talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nine years after Australia restarted offshore processing, and more than seven years since the last asylum seeker was sent offshore, 239 refugees and asylum seekers remain held within Australia’s offshore islands processing regime: 109 on Nauru and 130 in Papua New Guinea.</p> <p>According to government figures, 1,223 “transitory persons” are in Australia, brought back from offshore processing islands.

It was fuelled, she says, by a culture of restrictive eating amongst competitive cyclists driven to drop weight to boost their performance, and reinforced by offhand comments from coaching staff. “I thought, maybe you just have to cope with these things. Maybe this is how it is.”</p> <p>But soon after her national title, Malseed’s performance went downhill. Years of training and eating only the bare minimum caught up with her in her first year of professional racing. “I couldn’t finish races. I couldn’t stay with the peloton; I was getting dropped all the time,” she says. Then she started breaking bones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/26/liz-cambage-curt-miller-weight-comments-wnba-basketball\">Liz Cambage and the perverse need to cut powerful women down to size</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I realised that didn’t love the sport anymore,” says Malseed, who is now retired. “I didn’t want to sacrifice my body anymore, my mental health and my relationships.”</p> <p>What Malseed experienced was a condition known as low energy availability that can, and did, escalate into a syndrome called <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2014-093502\">relative energy deficiency in sport</a>, or Red-S. It is a mismatch between an athlete’s energy intake and energy output that means little energy is left to fuel their body’s essential needs.</p> <p>Frequent illness, sluggish recovery, low iron levels and fatigue are common warning signs of the condition. Women might also have disrupted menstrual cycles or lose their periods. Red-S is often seen in endurance athletes and weight-classed sports, such as rowing, where it can quickly derail performance and sporting careers.</p> <p>“It can affect female and male athletes in any sport, at any time,” says Dr Kimberley Wells, a sport and exercise medicine registrar. But it is usually not until athletes are confronted with serious injuries, such as broken bones and stress fractures, that they realise something is amiss, Wells says.</p> <p>Female athletes like Malseed have also had to reckon with <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/toxic-sport-cultures-are-damaging-female-athletes-health-but-we-can-do-better-128376\">power dynamics and toxic cultures in elite sports</a> that normalise extreme diets and equate low weight with better performance. “Often an athlete is driven to think about their performance now and not their health, later,” says Wells.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc522ed61c236aa31d146a2e7696ac09ba9a3874\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc522ed61c236aa31d146a2e7696ac09ba9a3874/0_112_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shannon Malseed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon Malseed at the Santos Women’s Tour in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kei Tsuji/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, an energy imbalance leading to Red-S can occur in many different scenarios, not only with disordered eating, says dietitian Louise Burke, professor of sports nutrition at the Australian Catholic University.</p> <p>Athletes may at times – after injury or an off-season, for example – need to lose weight or intensify their training, but they could be doing so in a way that is too fast or too extreme. “Sometimes the eagerness to get results means the energy restriction is much greater than the body is happy to handle,” Burke says. Athletes may also face financial hardship and simply cannot afford to buy the food they need to eat, she says.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2019-101517\">recent study of Australian athletes</a>, Burke and her colleagues at the Australian Institute of Sport found that across eight sports and 112 female athletes, nearly 40% of the group had between two and three symptoms of Red-S, and some showed signs of mental illness.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2018-0149\">many cases go unrecognised</a>, says Burke, especially in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2018-0182\">male athletes</a> and because the stigma surrounding disordered eating discourages people from seeking help. “What we’re trying to do now is to de-stigmatise it,” Burke says, “to recognise that [low energy availability] exists in many forms, and it can be managed well [to help athletes] meet their goals, in a safer way.”</p> <p>Sports dietitian Jessica Rothwell, a former racewalker and current national high performance nutrition lead for Athletics Australia, says that with the right nutrition, athletes can continue to train consistently, unhampered by injury or illness, to bring about training adaptations and body composition changes that lead to good performance.</p> <p>But managing energy needs and exercise can be challenging for junior athletes who might not have access to the same nutritional support as elite athletes, she says. These young contenders may also idealise the ultra-lean bodies of senior competitors before understanding that maintaining peak body composition year-round is often unsustainable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"22e5c4ee724e1877649b28ffdf537e797996a5b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22e5c4ee724e1877649b28ffdf537e797996a5b4/0_0_2318_3000/773.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Rothwell\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former racewalker Jessica Rothwell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt King/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“What I wish I had known,” says Rothwell, “is how to periodise your training and nutrition across various training periods, how much food you actually needed to eat and what that looks like practically, particularly at that junior level.”</p> <p>Rothwell says it can be a fine line for athletes between optimising peak body composition and falling into a chronic state of low energy availability so education is key, especially through puberty, adolescence, and in their transition from junior to senior sport. “It’s really about helping them to understand how to fuel their bodies, and how to do it properly” to optimise health and performance, and to prevent injury and illness, she says.</p> <p>Sports professionals and coaches also need to be clear on the rationale for assessing and monitoring body composition, to ensure the athlete is not placed at any risk, Rothwell says.</p> <p>Wells, a former professional cyclist herself, says “old-school thinking” that blames food intake or perceived excess weight as a reason for poor performance still persists in sport.</p> <p>But sporting bodies are trying to address the issue with education programs such as the AIS’ female performance and health initiative, led by Dr Rachel Harris.

But on the inside, Malseed was hurting, and often starving hungry. “I just thought that that’s what I needed to do to be the best,” Malseed says about her gruelling training and eating plans which developed into an unhealthy relationship with food. It was fuelled, she says, by a culture of restrictive eating amongst competitive cyclists driven to drop weight to boost their performance, and reinforced by offhand comments from coaching staff. “I thought, maybe you just have to cope with these things. Maybe this is how it is.” But soon after her national title, Malseed’s performance went downhill. Years of training and eating only the bare minimum caught up with her in her first year of professional racing. “I couldn’t finish races. I couldn’t stay with the peloton; I was getting dropped all the time,” she says. Then she started breaking bones. “I realised that didn’t love the sport anymore,” says Malseed, who is now retired. “I didn’t want to sacrifice my body anymore, my mental health and my relationships.” What Malseed experienced was a condition known as low energy availability that can, and did, escalate into a syndrome called relative energy deficiency in sport, or Red-S. It is a mismatch between an athlete’s energy intake and energy output that means little energy is left to fuel their body’s essential needs. Frequent illness, sluggish recovery, low iron levels and fatigue are common warning signs of the condition. Women might also have disrupted menstrual cycles or lose their periods. Red-S is often seen in endurance athletes and weight-classed sports, such as rowing, where it can quickly derail performance and sporting careers. “It can affect female and male athletes in any sport, at any time,” says Dr Kimberley Wells, a sport and exercise medicine registrar. But it is usually not until athletes are confronted with serious injuries, such as broken bones and stress fractures, that they realise something is amiss, Wells says. Female athletes like Malseed have also had to reckon with power dynamics and toxic cultures in elite sports that normalise extreme diets and equate low weight with better performance. “Often an athlete is driven to think about their performance now and not their health, later,” says Wells. However, an energy imbalance leading to Red-S can occur in many different scenarios, not only with disordered eating, says dietitian Louise Burke, professor of sports nutrition at the Australian Catholic University. Athletes may at times – after injury or an off-season, for example – need to lose weight or intensify their training, but they could be doing so in a way that is too fast or too extreme. “Sometimes the eagerness to get results means the energy restriction is much greater than the body is happy to handle,” Burke says. Athletes may also face financial hardship and simply cannot afford to buy the food they need to eat, she says. In a recent study of Australian athletes, Burke and her colleagues at the Australian Institute of Sport found that across eight sports and 112 female athletes, nearly 40% of the group had between two and three symptoms of Red-S, and some showed signs of mental illness. But many cases go unrecognised, says Burke, especially in male athletes and because the stigma surrounding disordered eating discourages people from seeking help. “What we’re trying to do now is to de-stigmatise it,” Burke says, “to recognise that [low energy availability] exists in many forms, and it can be managed well [to help athletes] meet their goals, in a safer way.” Sports dietitian Jessica Rothwell, a former racewalker and current national high performance nutrition lead for Athletics Australia, says that with the right nutrition, athletes can continue to train consistently, unhampered by injury or illness, to bring about training adaptations and body composition changes that lead to good performance. But managing energy needs and exercise can be challenging for junior athletes who might not have access to the same nutritional support as elite athletes, she says. These young contenders may also idealise the ultra-lean bodies of senior competitors before understanding that maintaining peak body composition year-round is often unsustainable. “What I wish I had known,” says Rothwell, “is how to periodise your training and nutrition across various training periods, how much food you actually needed to eat and what that looks like practically, particularly at that junior level.” Rothwell says it can be a fine line for athletes between optimising peak body composition and falling into a chronic state of low energy availability so education is key, especially through puberty, adolescence, and in their transition from junior to senior sport. “It’s really about helping them to understand how to fuel their bodies, and how to do it properly” to optimise health and performance, and to prevent injury and illness, she says. Sports professionals and coaches also need to be clear on the rationale for assessing and monitoring body composition, to ensure the athlete is not placed at any risk, Rothwell says. Wells, a former professional cyclist herself, says “old-school thinking” that blames food intake or perceived excess weight as a reason for poor performance still persists in sport. But sporting bodies are trying to address the issue with education programs such as the AIS’ female performance and health initiative, led by Dr Rachel Harris. The initiative supports research into optimal athlete performance and has education modules for athletes, coaches, parents and support staff to raise awareness of female-specific health considerations. However, Wells says some sports have more funding and education than other codes, so knowledge of Red-S still varies between sports. And according to Wells and Rothwell, the syndrome is also common amongst recreational athletes who would not identify as elite but whose energy requirements are significant all the same. “There are a lot of people running around in the community, who are low in energy and it’s leaching strength from their bones, it’s affecting their fertility,” says Wells. “Unfortunately, the consequences of doing that show up years down the track. But once it reaches that point, it is really hard to intervene to get back what you lost.” Malseed turned things around with the support of a dietitian and sports physician. But she says most elite cyclists are focused on making quick gains to win races without contemplating the lifelong consequences of their extreme training and eating habits. “To try and come back from the detriment that you’ve put on the body and your mind takes a lot longer [than dropping weight to get results],” says Malseed. “It takes a bloody long time to heal.”","charCount":"6975","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/clare-watson\">Clare Watson</a>"},{"headline":"Victorian woman banned from Flight Centre for 10 years after being given ‘prohibition notice’ ","standfirst":"<p>Businesswoman Elmas Saliba denies behaving badly towards travel agent staff after seeking refund for Cook Islands holiday cancelled by Covid </p>","trailText":"Businesswoman Elmas Saliba denies behaving badly towards travel agent staff after seeking refund for Cook Islands holiday cancelled by Covid ","byline":"Natasha May","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9c965a94de943e8494806d3e7466830c95738ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9c965a94de943e8494806d3e7466830c95738ea/0_156_790_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"Elle Saliba\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elle Saliba says she received a ‘prohibition notice’ from Flight Centre banning her from contacting staff members.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elle Saliba</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A businesswoman says she has been banned from using travel agent Flight Centre for 10 years after complaining to the company about a refund for a holiday cancelled due to Covid-19.</p> <p>Elmas Saliba, who had been a customer of Flight Centre for over 15 years, says she received the “prohibition notice” last week informing her she was banned from attending and transacting with any Flight Centre stores or making contact with staff members.</p> <p>The notice stated the “sanction is effectively immediately and is valid for 10 years from date of issue.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/16/its-ours-not-theirs-australians-still-fighting-for-a-refund-after-covid-travel-cancellations\">‘It’s ours, not theirs’: Australians still fighting for a refund after Covid travel cancellations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saliba, who runs a small business selling children’s furniture, said after receiving the note, “I sat there, and I cried for an hour and a half in shock.”</p> <p>“They made me feel like I went and I threatened them and made a scene.

When they start talking about substantive issues, she engages them in an in-depth discussion “on types of weapons that might have been used, the impact of those weapons on people on the ground, and the requirements of the laws of armed conflict”.</p> <p>“So we’re able to talk in a language that is understood,” she says.</p> <p>“We can share knowledge and experience that we’ve each brought from our pasts to be able to understand where the people we’re talking to might be coming from, what their considerations are from a military perspective, and then try and balance it with the needs of the people on the ground and the humanitarian perspective.”</p> <h2>Rules of war</h2> <p>The ICRC appoints armed and security forces delegates (known as “Fas delegates” from the French phrase “forces armées et de sécurité”) to push for compliance with the rules of war, which prohibit targeting civilians and torturing prisoners and limit the types of weapons the can be used to avoid unnecessary suffering.</p> <p>But like the numerous militaries from which it draws its delegates, it has made slow progress improving its gender balance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9044645ff3897b4d6b238a5224ac5a01a0c5b1ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9044645ff3897b4d6b238a5224ac5a01a0c5b1ac/0_30_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kath Stewart, armed and security forces delegate for the International Committee of the Red Cross.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kath Stewart, armed and security forces delegate for the International Committee of the Red Cross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It had just one female Fas delegate in 2018. There are now eight, or 13% of all such delegates. Included in the ranks are military and armed group delegates – Stewart was the first woman to be appointed to that role, and there are now four worldwide.</p> <p>Appointing female Fas delegates, says Stewart, helps break down stereotypes and “opens it up for future women who are coming through”. The ICRC is stepping up its efforts to recruit more women to these positions.</p> <p>“The big issue is it’s low because the ICRC are hiring people that have previous experience,” Stewart says.</p> <p>“And most militaries and police forces did not employ women in the breadth of jobs, really, until at the earliest the 1980s – and a number of defence forces way later than that.”</p> <p>In her case, being attracted to electrical engineering sparked her interest in joining the army. She entered the ADF academy when it opened in 1986 and joined the Royal Australian Corps of Signals, working with computer and radio equipment.</p> <p>“What was good about starting when I did was that was when the training for males and females really started to merge, and so the training that I did was exactly the same as my male counterparts.

It reminded all parties that direct and indiscriminate attacks against civilians were prohibited by international humanitarian law, any attack must be proportionate, and all necessary precautions must be taken to avoid civilian casualties. A ceasefire was reached on 21 May.</p> <p>While the ICRC jealously guards its independence and avoids commenting on political matters, Stewart addresses the humanitarian situation on the ground in Israel and the occupied territories in broad terms.</p> <p>“Obviously the region has had a history of conflict and unrest. And that has impacts on the humanitarian situation. The long-term conflict and long-term occupation has obvious impacts on the people,” she says.</p> <p>She cites the restriction of movement, use of force and housing demolitions as factors that affect the humanitarian situation: “There are impacts; they are negative impacts.

The Australian, who became the first woman to serve as a military and armed groups delegate with the International Committee of the Red Cross, says sometimes people mistake her for a secretary or a support person. “It’s a stereotypical thing, that I would be a support person rather than the main speaker,” the former army officer tells the Guardian in an interview focusing on the push to recruit more women into such roles. “And often in these groups, even if I was the more senior person, a number of the groups would defer to the man who was with me.” Until recently Stewart was based in Tel Aviv and active within Israel and the occupied territories, including the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights. She had meetings with groups including the Israel defence forces, Hamas, a number of other factions in Gaza, and the Palestinian security forces. “People often expect when you’re going to see them that you are going to be male rather than female because of the job that I do,” she says. “So often I will get there and it’ll be things like, the thank you present is a kaffiyeh [headscarf], which is for males – and so then they hand me a kaffiyeh, and it’s kind of like, ‘Oh but you’re female so we’ll have to find you something else.’ And then sometimes the something else is not particularly practical.” But Stewart finds her 33-year previous career with the Australian Defence Force can help her to strike up a rapport with people she meets. When they start talking about substantive issues, she engages them in an in-depth discussion “on types of weapons that might have been used, the impact of those weapons on people on the ground, and the requirements of the laws of armed conflict”. “So we’re able to talk in a language that is understood,” she says. “We can share knowledge and experience that we’ve each brought from our pasts to be able to understand where the people we’re talking to might be coming from, what their considerations are from a military perspective, and then try and balance it with the needs of the people on the ground and the humanitarian perspective.” Rules of war The ICRC appoints armed and security forces delegates (known as “Fas delegates” from the French phrase “forces armées et de sécurité”) to push for compliance with the rules of war, which prohibit targeting civilians and torturing prisoners and limit the types of weapons the can be used to avoid unnecessary suffering. But like the numerous militaries from which it draws its delegates, it has made slow progress improving its gender balance. It had just one female Fas delegate in 2018. There are now eight, or 13% of all such delegates. Included in the ranks are military and armed group delegates – Stewart was the first woman to be appointed to that role, and there are now four worldwide. Appointing female Fas delegates, says Stewart, helps break down stereotypes and “opens it up for future women who are coming through”. The ICRC is stepping up its efforts to recruit more women to these positions. “The big issue is it’s low because the ICRC are hiring people that have previous experience,” Stewart says. “And most militaries and police forces did not employ women in the breadth of jobs, really, until at the earliest the 1980s – and a number of defence forces way later than that.” In her case, being attracted to electrical engineering sparked her interest in joining the army. She entered the ADF academy when it opened in 1986 and joined the Royal Australian Corps of Signals, working with computer and radio equipment. “What was good about starting when I did was that was when the training for males and females really started to merge, and so the training that I did was exactly the same as my male counterparts. That gave me greater experience; I was able to deploy on operations and was able to do a lot of different jobs within the military,” Stewart says. “I lived in 11 different countries during that time, went on four different operations with the Australian military, and was also a defence attache in four different countries and worked with embassies, and that’s where I really saw the work of the Red Cross overseas … I decided after I’d finished my career in the army that it was a good opportunity for me to use my skills and have some different challenges in helping people.” Understanding the complexities Stewart’s assignment with the ICRC in Israel and the occupied territories – beginning in February 2019 – wasn’t the first time she had been stationed in the region and grappled with its complexities. She had a stint as a military observer with the UN Truce Supervision Organization around the turn of the century. “I worked on the border between Israel and Syria, and then on the border between Israel and Lebanon in 2000, which was quite an interesting time because it was the withdrawal of Israel from southern Lebanon, it was when Bashar al-Assad came to power in Syria and it was also the start of the second intifada,” she says. “So that just gave me a good understanding of the region and introduction to the complexities that exists.” Tensions boiled over earlier this month when 11 days of fighting between Israel and Hamas left at least 230 Palestinians dead, including 65 children and 39 women, according to figures compiled by the Gaza health ministry. The death toll in Israel was 12, including a five-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl. On 11 May, the ICRC issued a public plea for the rules of law to be followed, as it warned that rockets in Israel and airstrikes in Gaza represented “a dangerous escalation” in a cycle of violence. It reminded all parties that direct and indiscriminate attacks against civilians were prohibited by international humanitarian law, any attack must be proportionate, and all necessary precautions must be taken to avoid civilian casualties. A ceasefire was reached on 21 May. While the ICRC jealously guards its independence and avoids commenting on political matters, Stewart addresses the humanitarian situation on the ground in Israel and the occupied territories in broad terms. “Obviously the region has had a history of conflict and unrest. And that has impacts on the humanitarian situation. The long-term conflict and long-term occupation has obvious impacts on the people,” she says. She cites the restriction of movement, use of force and housing demolitions as factors that affect the humanitarian situation: “There are impacts; they are negative impacts. And they’re negative impacts on the dignity of the people over there, their ability to have a livelihood, their ability to develop or sustain growth.” Brereton inquiry into war crimes Stewart will remain in contact with the Australian government in her next role with the ICRC. After being based in Canberra over the past couple of months, she is due to fly on Thursday to Tokyo, where she will serve as an ICRC armed forces delegate primarily working with the Japanese government and its self-defence forces. Although based in Japan, her responsibilities will include conversations with Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, “reminding of them of their obligations under international humanitarian law and providing them information on what might be best practice in some areas”. It comes as Australia grapples with the results of a long-running inquiry into alleged war crimes by its special forces in Afghanistan, with the Brereton inquiry finding “credible” evidence to implicate 25 current or former ADF personnel in the alleged unlawful killing of 39 individuals and the cruel treatment of two others. The government has set up an office of the special investigator, which will review the available evidence before potential prosecutions. The ICRC’s mission in Australia vowed to work with the ADF to strengthen respect for international humanitarian law. When asked about the fallout from the Brereton inquiry, Stewart is guarded about specific cases, but stresses the importance of the Geneva conventions. “It’s really important that we do have some boundaries around what actions can be taken in war, and particularly some legal boundaries that are well known to all of those that do carry weapons, because they have such an impact on the fate and the livelihoods of the civilians who are not part of the conflict but are grossly impacted by it,” she says.","charCount":"8502","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/daniel-hurst\">Daniel Hurst</a> Foreign affairs and defence correspondent"}]

But we also know that the government did a lessons learned review, and they failed to publish the results of that.

Hancock says life in government “has got easier” since Cummings left. William Wragg (Con) asks Hancock if he agrees that it is odd that people who used to regard Dominic Cummings as a “latter day King Herod, whose words and deeds could not be trusted” into a prophet, whose truth was written on tablets. Hancock says the public want the government to focus on dealing with Covid. Mark Logan (Con) says his local health officials say they are fans of Hancock’s. He thanks Hancock for his engagement with MPs. And he thanks him in particular for his work for Bolton. This gives a general flavour of the tone that Tory MPs have been adopting to Hancock in this session. Some of them have been inviting him to their constituencies too. These are from the Critic’s Rob Hutton. Hancock told MPs the public inquiry would cover not just how the UK government handled the pandemic, but how the Scottish and Welsh governments, and the Northern Ireland executive, handled it too. But how that would be done was yet to be determined, he said. Neale Hanvey (Alba) asks if Hancock told colleagues that people would be tested before being discharged into care homes. Hancock says so many of yesterday’s allegations were unsubstantiated. He says the Scottish government had to respond to the same problems, as did governments in other countries. He says testing was increased. And because of that testing was then rolled out more broadly. Hancock refuses to deny Cummings claim he told colleagues patients would be tested before being discharged into care homes. Mark Harper (Con) asks about the India variant. He says he thinks the vaccines are very effective at stopping serious disease, including from the Indian variant. If that is the case, does Hancock agree that full reopening should go ahead from 21 June. Hancock says this is the key question. In Covid hotspots, he says one person in 10 in hospital has had both jabs. He says this suggests that we can have a “high degree of confidence” that the vaccines are effective against serious illness. But it also shows they are not 100% effective, he says. He says we will know more about this in the coming weeks. Munira Wilson (Lib Dem) says if the government did sent people back to care homes without being tested, that was one of the biggest scandals. When was testing for discharged patients routinely offered? Hancock says this has been a challenging time. He says the government published full details of the approach it took. It worked with the care home sector on keeping people safe, and followed the clinical advice. Cherilyn Mackrory (Con) told Hancock in the Commons he should “ignore unsubstantiated Westminster gossip” and carry on with his job. Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the Commons health committee, says the allegations made by Dominic Cummings are serious, and as yet should be treated as “unproven”. He asks if Prof Neil Fergusion was right to say the India variant is now dominant. (See 9.52am.) Hancock says the India variant is spreading across the country. Estimates vary as to what proportion of new cases it accounts for. He says it is too early to say if it will be safe to take further steps on 21 June. A formal assessment will be taken before 14 June, he says Hancock is replying to Ashworth. He says “these unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true”. He says he has been “straight with people” in public and in private. He says every day he has gone into work thinking about what he can do to save lives. And he says he has been accountable, making more than 60 Commons statements and holding 84 press conferences. UPDATE: Hancock said: These allegations that were put yesterday - and repeated by [Jonathan Ashworth] - are serious allegations and I welcome the opportunity to come to the house to put formally on the record that these unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true and I’ve been straight with people in public and in private throughout. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is speaking now. He says the public deserve answers. Are the claims false? Why were people discharged into care homes without tests? Did Hancock tell No 10 people would be tested? Why did he not insist on a precautionary approach? Vaccines are now open to people aged 30 and above, he says. And he says it is on track to get every adult vaccinated by the end of July. Setting ambitious targets in government is how you get things done, he says. (That is is first reference to Dominic Cummings, who criticised Hancock over his 100,000 tests per day target.) And that’s it. He does not address the Cummings allegations directly. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is welcomed by loudish Tory cheering as he stands up. He says the pandemic is not over yet. The vaccination programme has reached 73% of the adult population. But that means more than a quarter of people have not been vaccinated. He says the number of cases yesterday was at the highest level since 12 April. But he says the link between cases and hospitalisation has been broken. In the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts the urgent question by reminding MPs that they are not normally meant to accuse each other of lying. As well as doing interviews this morning, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, had his first jab. He is 39. That means every member of the cabinet has had at least one dose, Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccine deployment minister, says. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is about to answer an urgent question from Labour about his handling of coronavirus. Here is my colleague Aubrey Allegretti’s preview story. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, suggested the government was “wilfully neglectful” in its handling of coronavirus. In an interview with Sky News this morning she said: The public inquiry should start immediately. But we also know that the government did a lessons learned review, and they failed to publish the results of that. I think the public need reassurance by making sure that that is in the public domain ... There are serious questions for today, not just about what happened in the past, but how do we protect our loved ones today. And if the government were wilfully neglectful, knowing that they were going to put people’s lives at risk, people need to know that now. It was not clear from the interview whether Rayner intended to go this far or not. There is a lot of evidence to support the claim that government errors cost lives. But to say it was done “wilfully” implies an intent to cause harm. When the presenter, Stephen Dixon, challenged Rayner as to whether that was what she really meant, she did not retract the claim, but she did not elaborate on it either. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, declined to answer questions about Dominic Cummings when he left home this morning. Speaking to reporters outside his house in north-west London, Hancock said: I’m just off to drive forward the vaccine programme and then I’ll be going to the House of Commons and I’ll answer questions there. Labour has moved the writ for the Batley and Spen byelection to take place on Thursday 1 July. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose modelling played a key role in persuading Boris Johnson to order the original lockdown last year, told the Today programme this morning that the variant originating in India (B.1.617.2) is now the dominant one in the UK. He said: It’s now in well over the majority of local authority areas in the country and is now the dominant strain. The majority of new cases are of the variant - that is obviously concerning. It’s gone from being really a small minority a month ago to the majority variant. Ferguson said this meant that whether or not England would be able to go ahead with step 4 of the roadmap - the lifting of all remaining restrictions - was “in the balance”. He explained: Step 4 is rather in the balance, the data collected in the next two to three weeks will be critical. The key issue as to whether we can go forward is: will the surge caused by the Indian variant - and we do think there will be a surge - be more than has been already planned in to the relaxation measures? So it was always expected that relaxation would lead to a surge in infections and to some extent a small third wave of transmission - that’s inevitable if you allow contact rates in population to go up, even despite immunity - [but] we can’t cope with that being too large. In the next two or three weeks we will be able to come to a firm assessment of whether it’s possible to go forward. Ferguson also restated his claim that locking down a week early in March 2020 would have saved 20,000 to 30,000 lives. He said: I think that’s unarguable. I mean, the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks 13 to 23 March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives. Good morning.

He knows that he is at the heart of Real Madrid and that Real Madrid is and will always be his home.” Zidane had a first spell in charge of Madrid from January 2016 to May 2018 and returned in March 2019. Off the field this season Madrid were one of the key players behind the failed Super League breakaway with the club president, Florentino Pérez, repeatedly defending the plan and engaging in a war of words with Uefa that shows no sign of slowing down. Zidane won his second La Liga title in the Covid-affected 2019-20 season. In his first stint he won three Champions Leagues and the 2016-17 Spanish league.","charCount":"1439","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a

Gloucestershire constabulary said on Thursday: “Excavation work at the Clean Plate cafe has now been completed and we can confirm no human remains or items of significance to the investigation have been found. “Digging to access and examine six areas of interest or ‘anomalies’ in the cellar area began last Wednesday. “The anomalies were identified by a team of expert forensic archaeologists and anthropologists ahead of the excavation work, with the experts able to determine that the remaining areas of the cellar had been undisturbed since prior to 1968, when Mary Bastholm disappeared. “Each area was carefully examined by the forensics team with support from officers from the constabulary. The team worked each day, everything that was dug up was analysed on site and all activity was meticulously logged and photographed. “Mary’s family have been updated and is continuing to receive support from family liaison officers. The cafe will be handed back to its owners once reparation work is completed.” The police investigation began after a TV company working on a documentary about Mary’s disappearance in 1968 found two voids in the basement. Experts drilled into one of the voids and a cadaver-detecting dog indicated there could be something in the hole. They dropped a camera down and spotted what appeared to be blue material. When Mary went missing she was wearing a blue coat and a blue and white dress, and had a blue bag. The documentary team passed on their findings and police found four more voids. West was previously suspected of killing Mary. Along with his wife, Rose West, he tortured, raped and murdered an unknown number of women over a 20-year period. West is said to have confessed to his son, Stephen, that he had killed Mary but did not admit it to police. The girl’s body was not found during the 1994 excavation of the Wests’ home on Cromwell Street in Gloucester. West was charged with 12 murders, but took his own life in prison in 1995, aged 53, before his trial. Rose West was convicted of 10 murders in November 1995 and is serving a life sentence. There are conflicting reports over whether West was a regular at the cafe, whether he did building work in the basement, or if he knew Mary. Rumours have circulated for years about the cafe basement but at the start of the dig the senior investigating officer, DCI John Turner, said: “Fred lied to a lot of people, sent police off on wild goose chases all around the country, which has been heartbreaking over the years for lots of family members including the Bastholms. Just because Fred said he did it, it doesn’t mean to say he did. “Fred most definitely played with investigators, he wanted to control the investigation, he enjoyed being the centre of attention and he was toying with us at times.”","charCount":"3188","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/stevenmorris\">Steven Morris</a>"},{"headline":"Covid live: Olympics could cause new variant, doctor warns; India simplifies vaccine approvals to speed up rollout","standfirst":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/27/coronavirus-live-news-facebook-covid-biden-man-made-manufactured?page=with:block-60af3cb68f088d8c3178a7f4#block-60af3cb68f088d8c3178a7f4\">Head of Japanese doctors union warns of risk if Games go ahead</a>; India <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/may/27/coronavirus-live-news-facebook-covid-biden-man-made-manufactured?page=with:block-60af5bce8f08d486a7714771#block-60af5bce8f08d486a7714771\">scraps local trial requirement to boost number of jabs amid crisis </a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/26/joe-biden-us-intelligence-community-covid-19-origins-china\">Biden orders US intelligence to intensify efforts to study Covid’s origins</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/26/german-scientists-say-they-can-help-improve-vaccines-to-prevent-blood-clots\">German scientists say they can improve vaccines to prevent blood clots</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/taiwan-president-accuses-china-interfering-covid-vaccine-deals\">Taiwan accuses China of interfering with Covid vaccine deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/27/record-pace-of-melbourne-covid-outbreak-and-delayed-vaccine-rollout-blamed-for-victoria-lockdown\">Record pace of Melbourne outbreak blamed for Victoria lockdown</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/may/27/uk-covid-live-news-cummings-wrong-to-say-tens-of-thousands-died-needlessly-minister-says\">UK Covid updates - live</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Head of Japanese doctors union warns of risk if Games go ahead; India scraps local trial requirement to boost number of jabs amid crisis ","byline":"Yohannes Lowe (now), Martin Belam and Helen Sullivan (earlier)","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6af072dddcb6affcfa42fc0e6b8a372763d00e32\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6af072dddcb6affcfa42fc0e6b8a372763d00e32/0_307_4716_2831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman receives a vaccine dose in Jammu, Kashmir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman receives a vaccine dose in Jammu, Kashmir.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60af712e8f08d486a7714898\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T10:15:23.887Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This has been shared by ABC 7.30:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/abc730/status/1397850842552700930\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Hotel quarantine has done well until now, but particularly with the deluge of cases that are coming from overseas ... we need to find longer term solutions which include places like Howard Springs.\" – Chris Moy, Australian Medical Association <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/abc730?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#abc730</a></p>— abc730 (@abc730) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/abc730/status/1397850842552700930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 27, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60af6ea48f088d8c3178aa87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T10:04:25.526Z\">11.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe.

This was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of government, and all parts of the country. I think the public will appreciate, if you think back to the events of this time last year, how challenging it really was. Many things happen, of course they’ll be things which we could have done better and we’re learning those lessons as we go along.</p> \n  <p>“The public inquiry will air that and hear the evidence in a reasoned and reflective manner.

I’ll be with you for the next few hours. We’ve just published this from <strong>Dr Deepti Gurdasani</strong>, who is a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London:</em></p> \n  <p>Amid the select committee revelations from <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong>, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the UK government was following a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/23/priti-patel-denies-cummings-claim-herd-immunity-was-ever-uk-policy\">herd immunity</a>” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising.</p> \n  <p>It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/boris-johnson-coronavirus-this-morning/\">prime minister</a> and by many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kilsally/status/1238780879050326016?s=20\">scientific advisers</a> to the government – including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XRc389TvG8\">Patrick Vallance</a>, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity.</p> \n  <p>The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied.</p> \n  <p>There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy.</p> \n  <p>Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster\">Deepti Gurdasani – The UK government’s Covid strategy was discredited but we’re still paying the price</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/27/government-covid-strategy-herd-immunity-westminster\">The government's Covid strategy was discredited but we're still paying the price | Deepti Gurdasani</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T06:14:03.432Z\">at 7.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60af35588f088d8c3178a79d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T06:00:22.782Z\">7.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Facebook to allow posts saying Covid ‘man-made’</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims\">Facebook’s statement</a> on its change of policy: </p> \n  <p>In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps.

I’ll be running the blog until the evening (UK time). As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to ‘redouble’ its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. China has pushed back, saying that the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Facebook is changing its policy to allow posts saying Covid is “man-made”. A statement from the US tech giant said “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps.” Japan pledged on Thursday to keep in close contact with Olympics stakeholders at home and abroad to ensure a safe and secure Games even as it prepared to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation, including host city Tokyo. The head of a Japanese doctors union warned holding the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people gathering from around the world, could lead to the development of a new “Olympic” strain of the coronavirus. India is changing its approach to vaccines – announcing that it has scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to fast-track imports. The government said it was in talks with Pfizer for “earliest possible” imports of its shots and that it had also had discussions with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna. Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week, in a sign that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Taiwan’s president has accused China of interfering in its vaccine acquisition. President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca and Moderna, and were engaging with BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered. Ireland’s health minister has said it was unclear whether enough supplies of Covid-19 vaccines would arrive in the country by the end of June to meet the government’s target of administering at least one dose to 82% of all adults. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. From 8am this morning, all adults in Northern Ireland have been able to book a vaccination. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. Two Covid-19 vaccines from China’s Sinopharm showed more than 70% efficacy against symptomatic cases, but it remains unclear how much protection they provide against severe or asymptomatic cases, according to the first detailed result of a large late-stage study published to the public. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Britain’s GSK have announced the start of final tests of their belated Covid vaccine as they race to add their jab to the world’s arsenal against the pandemic. A major Australian retail group has been hit with $630,000 in fines for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised. British politics is almost entirely dominated today by responses to yesterday’s assertions by former government adviser Dominic Cummings about how the UK government handled the pandemic. Andrew Sparrow has the latest on our UK live blog… Yohannes Lowe will be with you shortly to take you through the rest of the day. In a not entirely unexpected move, China has this morning pushed back against new moves to investigate the origins of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan. It accused the Biden administration in the US of playing politics and shirking its responsibility in calling for a renewed investigation. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing that President Joe Biden’s order showed the US “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.” Biden told US intelligence officials to redouble their efforts to investigate the origins of the pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese laboratory. After months of minimizing that possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is joining worldwide pressure on China to be more open about the outbreak, in part aiming to head off domestic US complaints from Republican that the president has not been tough enough to press China on alleged obstruction. Regular watcher of US-China relations will know that in the daily press briefings Zhao usually has something to say about the US, and today has said the country must open itself up to investigations into its biological laboratories, including at the military’s Fort Detrick base. “The US side claims that it wants China to participate in a comprehensive, transparent, evidence-based international investigation,” Zhao said. “We would like to ask the US side to do the same as China and immediately cooperate with the World Health Organization on origin tracing research in a scientific manner.” Ireland’s health minister has said it was unclear whether enough supplies of Covid-19 vaccines would arrive in the country by the end of June to meet the government’s target of administering at least one dose to 82% of all adults. Half of Ireland’s 3.8 million adult population will have received at least one dose by the end of this week, Stephen Donnelly told parliament. But he cautioned that there was continued uncertainty around the arrival of AstraZeneca and in particular Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. Reuters report that Ireland had been due to receive 600,000 shots of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-dose Janssen vaccine in the April-June period but only 26,400 shots had been delivered as of 9 May, with the vast majority set to be delivered next month. “For June we were contracted to receive about 470,000 doses of Janssen. The best case I have as of this morning is that we would receive about half of that and the worst case could be as low as around 60,000 in June,” Donnelly said. “With regards to AstraZeneca, we don’t know yet but as we know unfortunately, the supplies from AstraZeneca have consistently been under. The company has not been able to give detail as to how much it will be under for June.” Catarina Demony and Silvio Castellanos report from Porto that as thousands of English football fans flock to Portugal’s city of Porto for Saturday’s Champions League final, hotels and bars are hoping the tourism boost will be a prelude to their emergence from a collapse brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is definitely a boost for most hotels,” hotel general manager Francisco Brito told Reuters as a couple checked in behind him. “No one ever thought we could experience such a brutal hit ... it is a huge satisfaction to be back in business.” Portugal’s once-booming tourism sector suffered its worst results since the mid-1980s last year as Covid-19 grounded flights and kept visitors away. Tourism businesses across Porto have been mostly empty, leaving workers in a tight spot. Many were pushed into unemployment. Those who managed to stay afloat breathed a sigh of relief when this month UEFA moved the final from Istanbul to Porto’s Dragao Stadium after Turkey was added to the British government’s coronavirus travel-ban “red list”. Some of the city’s hotels were able to finally reopen as demand grew exponentially due to the match, Brito said. Although most of the 16,500 fans who will be allowed into the stadium will have to complete the trip within 24 hours of the final and remain in a bubble during their stay, many others have been travelling to Porto to support their teams from the sidelines. Olivier Ramadas, co-owner of sports bar Adega, said calls and emails from fans wanting to book a table for match day started pouring on the day of UEFA’s announcement. “When we received the news we felt a huge joy,” he said as English fans who arrived a few days early drank pints of beer and chatted. “It will revive the city.” Two Covid-19 vaccines from China’s Sinopharm showed more than 70% efficacy against symptomatic cases, but it remains unclear how much protection they provide against severe or asymptomatic cases, according to the first detailed result of a large late-stage study published to the public. A vaccine developed by a Wuhan-based subsidiary of Sinopharm was 72.8% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 at least two weeks after second injection, based on interim results, the peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed on Wednesday. Reuters note that this is slightly better than the 72.5% rate announced in a company statement in February. Another vaccine developed by a Beijing-based institute linked to Sinopharm, which this month obtained emergency use approval by the World Health Organization, showed a 78.1% efficacy, the paper said. India is changing its approach to vaccines – announcing that it has scrapped local trials for “well-established” foreign coronavirus vaccines to fast-track imports. The country has been inoculating its people with the AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally at the Serum Institute, Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech, and has begun rolling out Russia’s Sputnik V. But supplies are far short of the millions of doses the world’s second-most populous country needs. The government said it was in talks with Pfizer for “earliest possible” imports of its shots and that it had also had discussions with Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna. Last month, India pledged to fast-track approvals for foreign vaccines but its insistence on local trials was a key reason for stalled discussions with Pfizer. “The provision has now been further amended to waive the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries,” the government said in a statement. None of drugmakers has sent in applications for approval with India’s drugs regulator, it said. Reuters have reported that desperate Indian states have been launching global tenders or seeking expressions of interest from firms including Pfizer and Moderna, but vaccine makers said they would only talk with the federal government. The government said supplies were tight. “The fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirms what we have been telling the states from day one: that vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice,” it said. Andrew Sparrow is up and running for the day with our UK Covid live blog, so the latest fall-out from the Dominic Cummings revelations will be with him over there, and I’ll be continuing with global coronavirus news here. Indonesia has resumed usage of a temporarily suspended batch of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, the country’s food and drug agency (BPOM) said this morning. Reuters report that the agency suspended use of one batch of the vaccine to conduct an investigation after a young man died after being inoculated earlier this month. “According to test results, it can be concluded that there was no relation between the quality of Covid-19 vaccine batch number CTMAV547 with the post immunization event reported,” said BPOM. The hotline for booking a Covid-19 vaccine in Australia was unavailable for hours following the Victorian government’s decision to open up vaccinations to those aged over 40. As the acting premier, James Merlino, announced Victoria would go into a seven-day lockdown to get on top of a growing number of cases of Covid-19, he announced people aged between 40 and 49 would be able to get the Pfizer vaccine at state-run clinics from Friday. Merlino said it would be a matter for the federal government on whether the vaccine would be available for those in that age group at GP surgeries, but said the decision was arrived at due to frustration over the slow pace of the vaccine rollout. “If we had the vaccine, the commonwealth’s vaccine program effectively rolled out, we may well not be here today talking about these circuit-breaker restrictions that we must impose to keep our community safe.” Read more here: Victoria’s hotline for booking Covid vaccines crashes after being inundated with calls Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to ‘redouble’ its efforts studying the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. The deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the investigation would include any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese lab. “China wasn’t transparent enough,” she said. “We have been saying that for a very long time, that China needed to provide more access to the lab, cooperate more fully with the scientific investigators.” Adam Taylor at the Washington Post has this to say about the re-emergence of theories about a Wuhan lab leak being the source of the novel coronavirus. He writes: Well over a year since a novel coronavirus began to spread in Wuhan, the idea that the deadly outbreak could be linked to a virus research center in the Chinese city has lingered, unproven but not eliminated. Although the resurgent chatter may suggest new clues or proof, the inverse is in fact true. It is the persistent absence of any convincing evidence either for or against the theory that has prompted calls for more investigation. At least publicly, the evidence in favor of a link between the outbreak and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has not changed significantly in months, and many virologists still have persistent doubts that such a link exists. What has clearly changed, however, is the political debate. Most obviously, a new U.S. administration that is not so openly anti-China has led some former skeptics to reconsider the existing evidence. And public health experts — most of whom never ruled out the lab theory outright — have expressed disappointment with a World Health Organization-backed investigation that dismissed a link between WIV and the outbreak. Read more here: Washington Post – The Wuhan lab-leak theory is getting more attention. That’s because key evidence is still missing A major Australian retail group has been hit with $630,000 in fines for multiple breaches of consumer law related to pandemic-related health products, including hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised, the consumer watchdog has announced. Mosaic Brands Limited, an ASX-listed retail conglomerate that counts Katies, Rivers, Noni B and Rockmans among its stable of brands, has admitted to making false or misleading claims pertaining to hand sanitiser and face mask products between March and June 2020. The deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Delia Rickard, said they were particularly concerned about the misleading claims because they were made during a global pandemic. The fines come following tests by Choice, which found that the group was selling hand sanitiser with alcohol levels far lower than advertised. Choice issued a complaint to the ACCC, which conducted independent tests and found “one of the sanitisers tested contained an alcohol content of 17% and another had an alcohol content of 58%, below the percentage advertised on Mosaic Brands’ websites in each case. This was also below the minimum 60% alcohol concentration recommended by Australian health authorities,” Rickard said. Read more here: Australian retailer Mosaic Brands fined $630,000 for misleading hand sanitiser claims UK housing minister Robert Jenrick must be thrilled he got the job of facing the media this morning. He’s just had Susanna Reid open his section with the simple question: “Where is the prime minister this morning?” Zachary Wolf at CNN had this an analysis overnight on how the US government now sees the search for the origins of the global pandemic as an intelligence-led operation. He writes: Intel operation, not scientific inquiry. Biden wants the intelligence community to cooperate with other elements of the government, but getting to the bottom of how this disease occurred, at least in the eyes of the president dealing with obstruction from China, is now fully an intelligence operation. But that order likely poses a complicated challenge for intelligence agencies, which, as CNN has repeatedly reported, are limited in their ability to confidently answer the question of what actually happened. While the intelligence community has been actively engaged on the issue since it broke, Biden’s order is a public call for more, despite the fact that it has been unable to make significant progress for more than a year. So it’s the CIA, not the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that the government is now looking to. And it’s the scientists, who were adamant a year ago that the lab theory was extremely unlikely, now saying it needs more exploration. That appears to be what caused this change. But while intelligence professionals have been more cautious in characterizing their own findings, the lack of apparent progress over the last year should temper expectations, especially considering that China is uninterested or unwilling to help any effort aimed at discovering the truth. Read more here: CNN – The origin of Covid is now an intelligence operation Taiwan has reported 401 new local cases confirmed today, 13 deaths, and an additional 266 backlogged results from the previous week, in a sign that the island’s worst outbreak of the pandemic is still spreading consistently despite restrictions on social movement. Among the 13 deaths - the highest daily toll for Taiwan so far - was a woman in her 40s. Health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung said most of the fatalities were elderly people. More than half of the new cases were in people under the age of 40, including 45 children aged up to nine. The new cases remain concentrated in the northern cities of New Taipei and Taipei. Issues with Taiwan’s test recording system has resulted in a backlog of thousands of results, with clearance work producing hundreds of cases to revised totals each day, making it difficult to determine clear trends. The number of backlogged cases is reportedly still growing as more tests come in, despite clearance efforts. Taiwan remains under a level 3 alert, which is not a full lockdown but instead restricts personal gatherings to five indoors and 10 outdoors, encourages but does not require working from home, and which has ordered entertainment and recreation venues to close. Yesterday restaurants were ordered to transition to takeaway services only. Alarmed by their first significant outbreak since the pandemic began, Taiwan’s population has largely complied with both mandatory and requested restrictions, staying home and avoiding travel. Almost 1500 people are in centralised quarantine facilities, established for people with asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 to reduce pressure on hospitals - several of which have recorded their own clusters of infections. Chen has said Taiwan will only move to level 4 alert - a lockdown - if there are 14 consecutive days of more than 100 cases (a milestone likely to be reached tomorrow), with 50% untraced (which has not been reached - just 145 of the total caseload remain unsourced). “I’m just off to drive forward the vaccine programme and then I’ll be going to the House of Commons and I’ll answer questions there.” That’s UK health minister Matt Hancock leaving his house this morning, being asked if the country can still have confidence in him. It was a suit today, not his running gear like yesterday. As you might expect, UK health secretary Matt Hancock is to respond today to those accusations by Dominic Cummings yesterday that he repeatedly lied and that he should have been fired 15 or 20 times over his handling of the early days of the pandemic. Hancock is to answer urgent questions in parliament at 10.30am and will later lead a Downing Street press conference, likely to be around 17.00. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi and Britain’s GSK have announced the start of final tests of their belated Covid vaccine as they race to add their jab to the world’s arsenal against the pandemic. AFP state that the companies reported positive results from interim human trials earlier this month after a disappointing outcome from initial studies last year left France without its own vaccine. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline have started enrolment for Phase 3 of a clinical study that will include more than 35,000 adult volunteers at sites in the United States, Asia, Africa and Latin America, the firms said. Sanofi and GSK will also study their vaccine’s ability to work as a booster shot in people who had previously received another vaccine. The Phase 2 trials already showed a strong immune response after a single shot in participants who had previously contracted the coronavirus. The companies hope to launch their vaccine by the end of 2021 - one year after Pfizer and Moderna jabs were approved by regulators. “We have adapted our vaccine development strategy based on forward-looking considerations as the virus continues to evolve, as well as anticipating what may be needed in a post-pandemic setting,” Sanofi executive vice president Thomas Triomphe said in a statement. Like most of the other jabs in circulation, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine would require two doses. Taiwan’s president has accused China of interfering in its vaccine acquisition, as the island continues to battle hundreds of daily new cases of Covid-19 with low supplies of vaccines. Taiwan has received about 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, for a population of 24 million. While the island had been largely Covid-free since the pandemic began, an outbreak in late April has so far infected more than 5,000 people, and killed at least 47. Less than 2% of the population are vaccinated. President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca from the UK and Moderna from the US, and were engaging with Germany’s BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered,” Tsai told a party meeting on Wednesday, in the most explicit comments to date, after months of suggestions that Beijing had been getting in the way of Taiwan’s procurement process. Pfizer-BioNTech reportedly has an exclusive deal with the Shanghai-based Fosun pharmaceuticals company to distribute the vaccine to the Greater China region, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Fosun has offered to supply Taiwan with vaccine doses, but Taiwan has said it is not possible. Beijing denies obstructing Taiwan’s deal with BioNtech and has accused Taiwan’s leaders of sacrificing the health of residents for politics. Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang party has accused Tsai of bungling the vaccine rollout. “Taiwan access to vaccines continues to be slowed down by Chinese interference, while they insist we buy Chinese-made ones,” said Taiwan’s presidential spokeswoman, Kolas Yotaka. “If you really want to help, please don’t stand in the doorway, don’t block up the hall.” Read more here: Taiwan accuses China of interfering with Covid vaccine deals Professor Susan Michie has ben on Sky News. She is a clinical psychologist at UCL. She described the lack of action and feedback from the UK government on scientific advice as “demoralising” and said that yesterday Dominic Cummings presented a “depressing” picture. She said: As a scientist, spending a lot of my last year, along with many other colleagues, thinking about science, writing about science, providing scientific advice on top of our day jobs, it is quite depressing to think that all that work, and all the many reports that we’ve produced weren’t landing, and possibly weren’t being considered. She went on to say: I think one of the frustrations about having given scientific advice over this last year is that there isn’t feedback … whether it was rejected because it wasn’t thought to be good, or maybe there are other political priorities. One never really knows what the explanation is when the advice we give isn’t being implemented. And I think that’s a shame because I think it’s quite demoralising for scientists. She also made a value for money argument about scientific advice being sidelined, saying: “I think it’s important for the public to know how taxpayers money is being spent, because obviously there’s a substantial expense to serving a big scientific infrastructure.” Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling was instrumental in persuading the UK government to bring in the first lockdown, said scientists had become increasingly concerned in the week leading up to 13 March 2020 about the lack of a clear plan, and 20,000 to 30,000 lives could have been saved with earlier action. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme when the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), of which he was part, determined that a policy of pursuing herd immunity would lead to a vast number of deaths, he said a key meeting was held with the NHS on 1 March “which finalised estimates around health impacts, so the week after that really.” PA report Ferguson said he “wasn’t privy to what officials were thinking within government”, but added: “I would say from the scientific side there was increasing concern that week leading up to the 13 of March about the lack of clear, let’s say, (a) resolved plan of what would happen in the next few days in terms of implementing social distancing.” He said: “I think one of the biggest lessons to learn in such circumstances is we really need good surveillance within the country at a much earlier point than we actually had it back in March last year. As we saw the data build up, and it was matching the modelling, even worse than the modelling, let’s say it focused minds”. He then said locking down a week earlier would have saved 20,000 to 30,000 lives “and I think that’s unarguable. I mean the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks 13th to 23rd of March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives”. Needless to say, lockdown sceptic Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, is having none of it. From 8am this morning, all adults in Northern Ireland will be able to book a vaccination. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I am delighted that our vaccination programme is now open to all adults in Northern Ireland. I know this will be very welcome news for young people who have been waiting patiently for their turn to get the jab.” You can check on the latest status of vaccination in all of the UK’s constituent countries here: NHS England NHS Scotland Gov.wales Northern Ireland As part of UK housing minister Robert Jenrick’s media round this morning, he is repeatedly trying to bat away accusations from former adviser Dominic Cummings by saying there will be a full inquiry in due course. This, in turn, is leading to him being pressed on the timing of that. He has roughly indicated “next spring”. The head of a Japanese doctors union on Thursday warned holding the Olympic Games in Tokyo this summer, with tens of thousands of people gathering from around the world, could lead to the development of a new “Olympic” strain of the coronavirus. With people from over 200 nations and territories set to arrive in Tokyo, it will be dangerous to host the Games in July, said Naoto Ueyama, head of the Japan Doctors Union. “All of the different mutant strains of the virus which exist in different places will be concentrated and gathering here in Tokyo. We cannot deny the possibility of even a new strain of the virus potentially emerging after the Olympics,” he told a news conference. “If such a situation were to arise, it could even mean a Tokyo Olympic strain of the virus being named in this way, which would be a huge tragedy and something which would be the target of criticism even for 100 years.” Japan pledged on Thursday to keep in close contact with Olympics stakeholders at home and abroad to ensure a safe and secure Games even as it prepared to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation, including host city Tokyo. Concerns remain rife about the safety of the 2020 Olympics, postponed for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, with public opinion polls showing a majority of Japanese are opposed to holding the Games this summer amid struggles to control a fourth wave of the coronavirus and sluggish vaccine rollout. Elaine Lies reports for Reuters that the government is currently preparing to extend a state of emergency across much of the nation originally set to be lifted on 31 May, most likely well into June, officials have said - just weeks before the Games are set to open on 23 July. Earlier this week, the United States advised against travel to Japan, but Olympics organisers have said this will not affect the Games. The White House on Wednesday said it had been assured by the Japanese government that it will keep in close contact about concerns over the Olympics. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan would continue making every effort to control the virus irrespective of the Olympics, and would be in close contact with concerned parties at home and abroad about the measures being taken in connection with the Games. “Careful anti-infection measures are a crucial part of being able to deliver a safe and secure event,” he told a news conference. “We will maintain close and periodic contact with all those concerned, both within the country and without, to explain what we’re doing on this score.” Robert Jenrick is the UK government minister out on media duties this morning – you can’t imagine he’s going to asked about anything else at all except Dominic Cummings. He’s just been on Sky News where he got quite an abrasive questioning and wasn’t exactly effusive in his defence of health secretary Matt Hancock. Asked if Hancock had lied repeatedly, as Cummings asserted yesterday, Jenrick fell back on standard lines about vaccine rollout and didn’t really address the question. He was pressed: “It’s no good you appearing on this programme if you are not prepared to answer questions, and with the greatest of respect, we’ve heard all about what the government’s doing with the rollout and we hear that every single day. But what people will take from your response to that first answer is you’re not prepared to back the health secretary. Why not?” Jenrick again responded with a fairly generic line, saying “I think that the department for health and the health secretary, have worked exceptionally hard over the course of this pandemic. This was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of government, and all parts of the country. I think the public will appreciate, if you think back to the events of this time last year, how challenging it really was. Many things happen, of course they’ll be things which we could have done better and we’re learning those lessons as we go along. “The public inquiry will air that and hear the evidence in a reasoned and reflective manner. I think that is the right way to do that. But absolutely, I think the country responded phenomenally to the events of last year. My point was that we are still responding to the pandemic, and that has to be the focus of government right now.” You can watch it here: Alexander Britton at PA has had a quick whizz round the British newspapers to gauge their reactions to the testimony yesterday of former UK government adviser Dominic Cummings on the early days of handling the Covid pandemic. The Independent, i and Daily Mirror all use the same quote headline: “Tens of thousands died who didn’t need to die”, with the latter carrying a leader column headlined “damning testimony”. The paper points out the problem of only hearing one side of the story, but that the Government “failed in this fundamental duty”. It says: “Cummings’ evidence may have been one-sided and selective but it should not be ignored. His criticisms of the Government’s handling of Covid demand an explanation. “The coward Johnson is trying to hide from accountability by delaying the public inquiry into Covid until next spring. We need to learn lessons now, not at his convenience.” The Daily Telegraph takes a different angle, suggesting an element of revenge from Cummings with associate editor Camilla Tominey writing “having expended his nine lives in government, this was also about settling scores”. The Sun’s headline - “Do you need a hindsight test, Mr Cummings?” - pokes fun at his well-publicised trip to Barnard Castle during the pandemic, while its leader column claims Mr Johnson will “dodge Dom’s bombs”. It adds people “recognise that our Government was one of many whose Covid response was found wanting. “The key difference since being the stellar success of our world-leading vaccine rollout. Voters are more likely to credit the Government with that and our rosier future than rake over the terrible bleakness of 2020 and the chaos in Downing Street.” Melbourne’s newest major arts festival, Rising, has been thrown into turmoil the day after opening with the Victorian government announcing a seven-day statewide lockdown from Thursday night. The hotly anticipated winter arts festival opened on Wednesday after an extended wait, only to “hit pause” on Thursday as the city entered a “circuit-breaker” lockdown that closed indoor and outdoor entertainment and arts venues and prohibited public gatherings. The acting premier, James Merlino, announced the lockdown on Thursday morning to halt the spread of what he called a “highly infectious” Covid-19 variant, spreading “faster than ever recorded”. Rising was due to run until Sunday 6 June. At the time of writing, the lockdown was scheduled to run until Friday 4 June. In response to the public health directive, Rising cancelled all events from 5pm Thursday until 4 June and committed to issuing refunds for all tickets for that period. “A decision in relation to events scheduled between 4 June and 6 June will be made over the coming week,” a statement issued by the festival said. Rising had been initially scheduled for 2020 but was cancelled due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Melbourne particularly hard, sending the city into back-to-back lockdowns that extended from March until October, and into a third snap lockdown earlier this year.

I’ll be with you for the next few hours. We’ve just published this from Dr Deepti Gurdasani, who is a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer in machine learning at Queen Mary University of London: Amid the select committee revelations from Dominic Cummings, and in his recent claims on social media, there has been a lot of focus on suggestions that the UK government was following a “herd immunity” policy at the start of the pandemic, costing thousands of lives in the process. Of course, none of this is surprising. It is very clear that this was the flawed policy of the government through early March last year, not least because it was publicly discussed by the prime minister and by many scientific advisers to the government – including Patrick Vallance, who spoke of “enough people becoming immune to this” with mild illness, to help build herd immunity. The alternative strategy of high suppression or elimination of the virus was rejected by the government very early on, despite strong evidence from other countries around the world showing that this could be successfully applied. There were several elements that underpinned the devastating herd immunity strategy. It was believed that infection of large swathes of the population was inevitable, and acceptable, and that there was no way to prevent it. This came with the tacit acknowledgment that hundreds of thousands of deaths were acceptable, most of which would occur among vulnerable and elderly people. A sense of national exceptionalism held by some suggested that other countries’ experiences didn’t apply to us – despite that by March we had had months to observe and learn from countries in south Asia, and seeing the devastating impact of late action in Italy. Real-world evidence was ignored in favour of models and flawed thinking. The government’s strategy repeatedly conflated Covid-19 with flu, ignoring the much higher transmissibility, higher susceptibility, which would lead to many more people getting infected and dying, and unknown long-term impacts from a novel virus. Finally, there was the idea that the health of the economy needed to be balanced with public health. A lot of emphasis was placed on the disruption lockdowns would cause, with attempts to slow down such decisions, without understanding that delays would inevitably lead to even longer lockdowns and more economic damage. Read more here: Deepti Gurdasani – The UK government’s Covid strategy was discredited but we’re still paying the price This is Facebook’s statement on its change of policy: In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured from our apps. We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge. In February this year, the World Health Organization team that visited Wuhan to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic all but dismissed a theory that the virus leaked from a laboratory. But their investigation was inconclusive as to what the origins of the theory actually were, and the theory that the virus was manufactured in a laboratory and escaped accidentally has again been raised in recent days as the United States and other countries call for a more in-depth investigation of the pandemic’s origins. Determining how the virus that causes Covid-19 began spreading is seen as vital to preventing future outbreaks. A long-delayed report by the team of international experts sent to Wuhan and their Chinese counterparts drew no firm conclusions as to the origins of the pandemic. Instead, they ranked a number of hypotheses according to how likely they believed they were. The report said the virus jumping from bats to humans via an intermediate animal was the most probable scenario, while it said a theory involving the virus leaking from a laboratory was “extremely unlikely”. After the report was released, however, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insisted all theories remained on the table. On Wednesday, Joe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation. Biden’s request included asking the US intelligence community to explore the unlikely possibility that the origins of the virus trace to Chinese lab. After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak.. After months of minimizing the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak. Hello and welcome to our ongoing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook has lifted a ban on posts claiming that Covid-19 was “man-made” or “manufactured” in “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid and in consultation with public health experts”. Here are the other key recent developments: Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot Covid vaccine is to be limited in Belgium to people aged 41 and over, authorities said following the death of a woman who received the jab. Switzerland is to re-open indoor restaurants and people will no longer be required to work from home, the government announced, saying it was lifting restrictions faster than previously planned. China accused the US of “spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation” after health chief Anthony Fauci said he was no longer convinced the coronavirus originated naturally – propelling the theory that it emerged from a Wuhan laboratory back into mainstream debate. The European Commission demanded an urgent court order requiring AstraZeneca to deliver millions more vaccines to the bloc or face a hefty fine, in a case that may reflect its anger more than its need for doses. Slovakia became the second EU country to authorise the use of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine, which has not yet been approved by the bloc’s drug regulator. France will impose a compulsory quarantine on travellers arriving from the UK because of growing concerns over the spread of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, the government’s spokesman has said. Whistleblower protection groups urged the World Health Organization to launch an independent review into the case of an Italian researcher who reported being pressured to falsify data in a now-spiked WHO report into Italy’s coronavirus response. Perhaps conveniently for an incumbent candidate, Zambian president Edgar Lungu banned campaign rallies ahead of elections scheduled for 12 August, saying large gatherings risked spreading the Covid-19 virus. Vets in several parts of Russia reportedly started vaccinating cats against Covid-19. Russia in March said it had registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine for animals. Only two animals in Russia, both cats, have so far tested positive for the virus.","charCount":"42556","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/yohannes-lowe\">Yohannes Lowe</a> (now), <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/helen-sullivan\">Helen Sullivan</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Airbus lifts jet production plans as ‘aviation recovery begins’ – business live","standfirst":"<p>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news</p><ul><li>Latest: UK online vacancies rise, as furlough total falls</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/27/airbus-a320-production-aviation-recovery-pandemic-markets-ftse-us-jobs-gdp-rates-business-live?page=with:block-60af33ad8f088d8c3178a794#block-60af33ad8f088d8c3178a794\">Airbus tells suppliers to prepare for higher A320 output</a></li><li>Plans to lift A320 production to 64/month by 2023, from 40/month now<br></li><li>Asks suppliers to prepare for possible further increases</li><li>Airbus CEO: Aviation sector is beginning to recover</li></ul>","trailText":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news","byline":"Graeme Wearden","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b56980770d6e3d78bd9d51094a509d8d6e8e319\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b56980770d6e3d78bd9d51094a509d8d6e8e319/0_0_5138_3082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Air France Airbus A320.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Air France Airbus A320.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60af6a168f086d71cc15c2f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T10:09:48.617Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Online vacancies rise and furloughed workers falls as UK economy reopens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The proportion of workers on furlough has fallen to its lowest level this year, as the UK economy emerges from lockdown.</strong></p> <p>New figures from the ONS shows that <strong>8%</strong> of the workforce were furloughed in the two weeks to May 16, the lowest total seen so far in 2021.

New figures from the ONS shows that 8% of the workforce were furloughed in the two weeks to May 16, the lowest total seen so far in 2021. That equates to around 2.2m, and is down from 10% around the start of the month. The report also shows a surge in people returning to restaurants since indoor dining was allowed again last week. Restaurant bookings in the week to Monday May 24th were 32% higher than their level two years earlier, as people took the opportunity to eat out indoors again. Firms are also posting more online job adverts - a sign that the economy is picking up as restrictions are relaxed. Online job adverts on 21 May 2021 were 18% higher than the average in February 2020 - an increase of 4 percentage points on last week, according to data from Adzuna. The largest weekly increase was for “transport, logistics and warehouse” jobs, which surged 21 percentage points to 275% of its February 2020 average level -- the highest level since the series began in February 2018. Manufacturers also posted more job adverts - up 14 percentage points week-on-week, to 231% of its February 2020 average level. But “catering and hospitality” saw a small dip, down 2 percentage points on last week, to around 113% of its February 2020 average. The ONS adds: This follows a recent upward trend for this category, having risen by 55 percentage points since 9 April 2021, just before the first easing of hospitality restrictions when pubs and restaurants reopened in England. Top US and Chinese trade negotiators held “candid” talks today, their first under the Biden presidency, as Washington continues to raise concerns over Beijing’s trade practices. In the long-awaited first official engagement between the US trade representative Katherine Tai and the Chinese vice-premier, Liu He, held virtually on Thursday morning Beijing time, the two sides emphasised the importance of the bilateral trade relations and agreed to further negotiations. A statement from China’s commerce ministry said the US and China held “candid, pragmatic and constructive exchanges with an attitude of equality and mutual respect”. In Washington, the office of the US trade representative said that Tai “discussed the guiding principles of the Biden-Harris administration’s worker-centred trade policy and her ongoing review of the US-China trade relationship, while also raising issues of concern.” Here’s the full story: The pandemic has hit profits at the publisher of the Daily Mail, although its investment in online car retailer Cazoo is more than cushioning the blow. Pre-tax profits at Daily Mail and General Trust fell 45% in the six months to the end of March to £42m, down from £77m a year earlier. Revenues dropped to £547m, from £642m. While its business-to-business information service grew revenues and profits, its events and exhibitions arm suffered a 95% drop in revenues amid the lockdown. The consumer media businesses (which includes the Daily Mail, Mailonline, Metro and the ‘i’) saw revenues drop 10% amid a volatile advertising market. DMGT’s 20% stake in used car seller Cazoo - which is floating in New York - is valued at $1.35bn, or around £957m. That means an eight-fold return on DMGT’s total investment of £117m, after it invested another £34m in Cazoo last October. CEO Paul Zwillenberg said: Our financial flexibility enabled us to continue to invest in Cazoo through multiple funding rounds. Despite the near-term economic uncertainty, we had conviction in its opportunity to transform the used car market. Cazoo continues to go from strength to strength and its proposed SPAC combination on the New York Stock Exchange would value our stake at US$1.35bn, a return of eight times on our capital. Shares in DMGT are up 3.3% this morning. Rolls-Royce, the jet engine maker, is leading the FTSE 100 risers this morning - up 3% - as Airbus’s announcement lifts the sector. Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s CEO, told Radio 4’s Today Programme that predicting the precise timing of the recovery was very difficult. East also points out that Covid-19 will have a permanent impact on the sector: The pandemic will undoubtedly change certain behaviours, and that’s reflected in our expectation of a smaller market in future than we would have expected pre-Covid. But we absolutely expect continued growth, because aviation is such an important part of the world economy. East was speaking as Rolls-Royce opened its new £90m engine testbed at its Derby factory. The largest in the world (bigger than a football pitch, apparently), it will test new engines before they’re put into service. While the pandemic has hit air travel, it has also created a boom in pet ownership. UK retailer Pets at Home has achieved sales of more than £1bn for the first time, as more people have turned to furry, feathered and scaled friends in the lockdown. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The retailer and vet chain estimated that pet numbers increased by 8% during a year in which many people were stuck at home. The boom has led to pet food shortages. The pandemic “structurally altered the dynamics of the UK pet care market”, the company said, with increased home working removing a barrier to pet ownership and increasing the emotional attachment to – and willingness to spend on – animals. Pets at Home revenues grew by 7.9% to £1.1bn in the year to 25 March, which coincided almost exactly with the start of the UK’s lockdowns. That was a record in the company’s 30-year history. It said there had been a pet “baby boom”. Sales of kitten and puppy products surged by 37% and 26% respectively, with training products and heated puppy beds in particular demand. Even less cuddly fish tank sales increased. The global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is lifting future demand for travel, as economies reopen and tourism picks up. So aircraft bosses need to take decisions now if they want suppliers to be ready for higher output in future. The FT’s Sylvia Pfeifer explains: The outlook for a longer-term recovery in aviation has improved with the global rollout of vaccines despite regional flare-ups. One of the biggest challenges for the industry is ensuring that its long, intricate supply chains are ready to ramp up production to meet the expected demand. Reuters says Airbus has laid out ‘sweeping goals’ to expand production of its A320 jetliners over the next few years (initially from 40 per month today to 45 by the end of the year, and 64 per month by Q2 2023). Demand for single-aisle jets is recovering as domestic travel rebounds, especially in the United States and China. In anticipation of a continued recovery in that market, Airbus is asking its suppliers to “enable a scenario” where it can produce 70 single-aisle jets a month by the first quarter of 2024. “Longer term, Airbus is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 (a month) by 2025,” it said. Analysts at Jefferies described the move by Boeing’s main rival as “punchy production plans”. Airbus is telling suppliers to prepare for an ‘aggressive ramp up’ of jet production, explains Richard Schuurman, aviation reporter for Air Insight. Airbus has boosted optimism for a global aviation recovery by alerting its suppliers prepare for a sharp increase in A320 production, says Bloomberg: Airbus SE is preparing to gear up production of its best-selling A320-series jets beyond pre-pandemic levels within two years, lending a jolt of optimism for a recovery in global aviation. The shares jumped after the world’s largest producer of commercial jetliners told suppliers to be ready to raise output of its top-selling narrow-body to a rate of 64 per month by the second quarter of 2023. That figure could rise to 70 a month early the following year and could reach 75 by 2025, Airbus said in a statement Thursday. The ambitious plan stands out in an industry that’s still struggling to gain traction after the Covid-19 pandemic wiped out demand for air travel. Despite short-term flareups in the outbreak, the longer-term picture has brightened with the global rollout of vaccines. Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing Co. have been showing more confidence even as pressure to lower emissions presents the next challenge for the industry. Shares in Airbus have jumped around 6% in early trading in Paris, as investors welcome its plans to boost production output over the next few years. They’re currently up €5.7 at €103.4, close to April’s one-year high. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After seeing demand battered by the pandemic, aerospace manufacturer Airbus says the recovery is beginning. It’s alerted its suppliers to prepare for a steep acceleration in production of its popular A320 single-aisle passenger jets, as it sets target above pre-pandemic levels in two years time. The European aerospace group has confirmed plans to increase A320 output to 45 jets per month in the last quarter of this year, from 40 at present. It has also set suppliers a new target -- 64 a month by the second quarter of 2023, and wants to ensure it has the long term capacity in place. That’s above the 60/month peak it hit in 2019, before Covid-19. Airbus says it expect the commercial aircraft market to recover to pre-COVID levels between 2023 and 2025, led by the single-aisle segment. Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, says this morning: “The aviation sector is beginning to recover from the COVID-19 crisis” Looking further ahead, Airbus is anticipating a “continued recovering market”. It also asking suppliers to “ enable a scenario” for production to expand further to 70 by the first quarter of 2024. And long term, it’s also investigating whether it could boost production to 75 by 2025. This steep ramp up looks like a sign of confidence in the recovery of the aviation industry from the pandemic - with Covid-19 vaccinations enabling a pick-up in international tourism. Faury says Airbus wants its suppliers to be ready for the pick-up in demand. “The message to our supplier community provides visibility to the entire industrial ecosystem to secure the necessary capabilities and be ready when market conditions call for it. In parallel, we are transforming our industrial system by optimising our aerostructures set-up and modernising our A320 Family production facilities. All these actions are set in motion to prepare our future.” Airbus is also slightly increasing its production goals for its small A220 jet, and the wide-body A350 - again, in a mix of provisional goals and firm plans. A220 Family: Currently at around rate five aircraft per month from Mirabel and Mobile, the rate is confirmed to rise to around six in early 2022. Airbus is also envisaging a monthly production rate of 14 by the middle of the decade. A350 Family: Currently at an average production rate of five per month, this is expected to increase to six by autumn 2022. A330 Family: Production remains at an average monthly production rate of two per month. Also coming up today Big Oil is reeling from a series of blows yesterday, over their failure to move faster to tackle the climate emergency. US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron both suffered shareholder rebellions, with 61% of Chevron shareholders supporting a resolution to set targets to reduce all of its emissions. Activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 got two directors elected to the board of ExxonMobil. And in a landmark case in the Hague, a Dutch court ruled that Royal Dutch Shell must reduce its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030. Dan Gocher, Director of Climate &amp; Environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) says these developments have “massive implications”. “This news is nothing short of extraordinary, and it will have massive implications for the Australian oil and gas industry. “Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell are three of Australia’s largest oil and gas producers, and therefore three of our largest carbon polluters. “All three companies will now be under enormous pressure from both shareholders and the wider public to cut emissions, and cut them fast. European markets are rather subdued, after a lacklustre day’s trading in Asia which saw Japan’s Nikkei drop 0.3% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng dip 0.2%. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA, says: Some of the week’s froth has come out of the markets in Asia today, with equities edging lower, along with energy and precious metals and our good friends, the cryptocurrency space, while the US Dollar edged higher after an impressive rally overnight. All the financial markets space, the price action looks corrective, rather than a structural turn, as short-term momentum ran out of the “inflation is dead, buy everything” that has swept markets this week.

And yet I continue to worry because there are other cases. I worry because there is such a strong acculturated sense about who is presumed innocent or not in racial encounters, about who may be categorized as inherently “angry” or “threatening”. (Part of Chauvin’s unsuccessful defense rested on trying to depict the protesting onlookers as distractingly “angry”, “threatening”, and unruly.)</p> <p>At this vexed moment, it is a truism that Americans of different races, ethnicities and religions are tense, wary of one another; but it is white fear of blackness that has the longest history, that is most intractable, and that still underwrites majoritarian tendencies to forgive even lethal police misconduct, and to rationalize punitive forms of segregation in housing, education and employment.</p> <p>In the domain of criminal procedure, that generalized fear is an evidentiary problem. Not just police officers, but self-appointed citizen vigilantes are often not prosecuted or charged at all when they allege mere free-floating decontextualized fear. If such cases actually proceed to trial – again, the Chauvin trial was a rarity – the deployment of wildly unreasonable subjective fear is often sufficient to justify killing innocent, unarmed people<em>. I feared for my life. Who are you to judge?</em></p> <p>These are the two forces that we must bring into contention as a widespread pattern of response. “I feared…” as a subjective standard of self-exoneration. And then the follow-up banishment of any juridical review of that fear: “Who are you to judge?”</p> <p>This pair of immunizing assertions is built into the very structure of recent so-called “stand your ground laws” that expand self-defense as licensing shooting to kill, unqualified by any duty to retreat, in public places even where there are other non-violent options. Although such laws are race-neutral in language, dominant American assumptions about who can claim a sidewalk or public street as ground that is “yours” is a highly raced proposition.</p> <p>Consider Mark McCloskey, a personal injury lawyer from Missouri who, days ago, announced his intention to run for US Senate in 2022. McCloskey achieved memed infamy last July when journalists captured pictures of him and his wife, Patricia, brandishing guns and aiming them at a group of mostly black protesters who were passing their house <em>en route</em> to the mayor’s residence located farther down the street. McCloskey’s campaign website describes the couple as having “held off a violent mob through the exercise of their 2nd Amendment rights”.</p> <p>But there was no violence: the McCloskeys were upset because the crowd had transgressed a wrought-iron gate at the top of the street which the couple felt marked a boundary line between the entire neighborhood complex as a “private” venue and the public thoroughfare beyond. (There are at least 285 gated streets in St Louis, part of what urban planner Oscar Newman called the “defensible space theory”, designed to create as sense of privacy even when residents benefit from publicly subsidized police, sewer, fire and water services.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d819f39e775ea5971f585c33c150d83cbf86ec7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d819f39e775ea5971f585c33c150d83cbf86ec7/0_129_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patricia McCloskey and her husband, Mark, draw their firearms on protestors passing their home in St Louis on 28 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patricia McCloskey and her husband, Mark, draw their firearms on protestors passing their home in St Louis on 28 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lawrence Bryant/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once the protesters passed through that gate, McCloskey claimed that they “may as well have been in my living room … I was frightened. I was assaulted.” He felt that it was “like the storming of the Bastille”. “They’re angry, they’re screaming. They’ve got spittle coming out of their mouths. They’re coming towards our house.” The couple’s decision to display and point guns – an AK15 assault rifle no less – was dressed in the legal terminology of immediacy, McCloskey insisting he was in “imminent fear” that “they would run me over, kill me”, and that “we’d be murdered within seconds. Our house would be burned down, our pets would be killed.”</p> <p>Again, the protesters were <em>not</em> in Mark McCloskey’s living room. They never so much as put foot on his lawn. They walked past his house. They did not “storm” his home. They passed, chanting loudly but entirely peacefully.</p> <p>In some neighborhoods any black person may be looked upon with suspicion. As a friend describes it, “it’s an almost magical power: we can inspire fear just by appearing.” I wish I could shrug off the McCloskey’s exaggerated fear as idiosyncratic or delusional, but it’s not isolated. Fox News pundits such as Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity give round-the-clock voice to the many white people who share the McCloskeys’ effusive and globalized fear of black people on “their” streets. That fear has inspired proliferation of dozens of “anti-riot” bills initiated in state legislatures, apparently aimed at Black Lives Matter protests (but not at the largely white crowds who broke into public buildings across the country culminating in the assault on the US Capitol on 6 January.)</p> <p>Consider just one bill, introduced in Alabama’s legislature in February 2021: had it been enacted, it would have “provide[d] that if an active riot is occurring within 500 feet of the premises, a person in lawful possession or control of the premises may use deadly physical force to defend the premises from criminal mischief or burglary”. Happily enough, the bill was defeated. But it illustrates a too-ubiquitous sentiment percolating through our polity. Authorizing not just the police but private citizens like the McCloskeys to use lethal force – based on subjective perceptions of danger to <em>things</em>, not just to persons – is a rationalized mitigation of culpability almost never extended in practice to black people.</p> <p>Mark McCloskey, meanwhile, has sworn fealty to “Donald Trump’s agenda” in announcing his new “call to public duty”. As his website summarizes it: “God came knocking on my door last summer disguised as an angry mob.”</p> <p>In the year since George Floyd died, I am relieved that the jury found Derek Chauvin guilty of murder. But anti-protest laws and anti-Black Lives Matter backlash have been significant responses to the attempted reform movement that his death inspired. I cannot yet dismiss the thrumming of those who insist that it is “natural”, obvious, rational and “reasonable” to apportion our collective fears by “colorblind” but coded hierarchies of racial “threat”. Fear should not govern everything. Fear cannot excuse everything. Fear heals nothing. And healing is the hard road still ahead.</p>","wordcount":"1337","firstPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T10:00:24Z","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2021-05-27T10:01:37Z","productionOffice":"US","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/p/hhkxp","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ce465b6c1d3902049dc9df1801cef17b1c76d8f/0_224_6720_4032/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","isLive":"true","bodyText":"It has been a year since George Floyd last drew breath.

I feared for my life. Who are you to judge? These are the two forces that we must bring into contention as a widespread pattern of response. “I feared…” as a subjective standard of self-exoneration. And then the follow-up banishment of any juridical review of that fear: “Who are you to judge?” This pair of immunizing assertions is built into the very structure of recent so-called “stand your ground laws” that expand self-defense as licensing shooting to kill, unqualified by any duty to retreat, in public places even where there are other non-violent options. Although such laws are race-neutral in language, dominant American assumptions about who can claim a sidewalk or public street as ground that is “yours” is a highly raced proposition. Consider Mark McCloskey, a personal injury lawyer from Missouri who, days ago, announced his intention to run for US Senate in 2022. McCloskey achieved memed infamy last July when journalists captured pictures of him and his wife, Patricia, brandishing guns and aiming them at a group of mostly black protesters who were passing their house en route to the mayor’s residence located farther down the street. McCloskey’s campaign website describes the couple as having “held off a violent mob through the exercise of their 2nd Amendment rights”. But there was no violence: the McCloskeys were upset because the crowd had transgressed a wrought-iron gate at the top of the street which the couple felt marked a boundary line between the entire neighborhood complex as a “private” venue and the public thoroughfare beyond. (There are at least 285 gated streets in St Louis, part of what urban planner Oscar Newman called the “defensible space theory”, designed to create as sense of privacy even when residents benefit from publicly subsidized police, sewer, fire and water services.) Once the protesters passed through that gate, McCloskey claimed that they “may as well have been in my living room … I was frightened. I was assaulted.” He felt that it was “like the storming of the Bastille”. “They’re angry, they’re screaming. They’ve got spittle coming out of their mouths. They’re coming towards our house.” The couple’s decision to display and point guns – an AK15 assault rifle no less – was dressed in the legal terminology of immediacy, McCloskey insisting he was in “imminent fear” that “they would run me over, kill me”, and that “we’d be murdered within seconds. Our house would be burned down, our pets would be killed.” Again, the protesters were not in Mark McCloskey’s living room. They never so much as put foot on his lawn. They walked past his house. They did not “storm” his home. They passed, chanting loudly but entirely peacefully. In some neighborhoods any black person may be looked upon with suspicion. As a friend describes it, “it’s an almost magical power: we can inspire fear just by appearing.” I wish I could shrug off the McCloskey’s exaggerated fear as idiosyncratic or delusional, but it’s not isolated. Fox News pundits such as Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity give round-the-clock voice to the many white people who share the McCloskeys’ effusive and globalized fear of black people on “their” streets. That fear has inspired proliferation of dozens of “anti-riot” bills initiated in state legislatures, apparently aimed at Black Lives Matter protests (but not at the largely white crowds who broke into public buildings across the country culminating in the assault on the US Capitol on 6 January.) Consider just one bill, introduced in Alabama’s legislature in February 2021: had it been enacted, it would have “provide[d] that if an active riot is occurring within 500 feet of the premises, a person in lawful possession or control of the premises may use deadly physical force to defend the premises from criminal mischief or burglary”. Happily enough, the bill was defeated. But it illustrates a too-ubiquitous sentiment percolating through our polity. Authorizing not just the police but private citizens like the McCloskeys to use lethal force – based on subjective perceptions of danger to things, not just to persons – is a rationalized mitigation of culpability almost never extended in practice to black people. Mark McCloskey, meanwhile, has sworn fealty to “Donald Trump’s agenda” in announcing his new “call to public duty”. As his website summarizes it: “God came knocking on my door last summer disguised as an angry mob.” In the year since George Floyd died, I am relieved that the jury found Derek Chauvin guilty of murder. But anti-protest laws and anti-Black Lives Matter backlash have been significant responses to the attempted reform movement that his death inspired. I cannot yet dismiss the thrumming of those who insist that it is “natural”, obvious, rational and “reasonable” to apportion our collective fears by “colorblind” but coded hierarchies of racial “threat”. Fear should not govern everything. Fear cannot excuse everything. Fear heals nothing. And healing is the hard road still ahead.","charCount":"8336","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/patricia-williams\">Patricia Williams</a>"}]

From AP: </p> <p>Thailand has been fighting to deal with a virus surge that began in early April in a group of nightclubs in Bangkok and has since spread around the country.</p> <p>The Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration reported a record 5,485 new cases, of which 1,953 were in prisons. Confirmed deaths increased by 19 to bring the total to 1,031 since the pandemic began last year.<br></p> <p>The total number of confirmed cases has now risen to 159,792, of which 82% occurred during the latest surge. Many of the cases are concentrated in prisons, housing for construction workers, factories, slums and low-income housing areas.</p> <p> Officials have in some cases been criticised for allowing companies to isolate and quarantine workers inside factories.</p> <p>Bangkok, which has been a hot spot in the outbreak, reported 1,356 of the cases on Monday. CCSA deputy spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangsan said the capital has 45 clusters to deal with.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Bangkok will slightly ease its lockdown measures starting tomorrow. In addition to reopening parks and botanical gardens, the city will allow limited numbers of visitors to museums, science parks, historical monuments, ancient places and art centres.<br></p> <p>Schools, bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues will remain closed, but tattoo parlours, nail salons, beauty and weight loss clinics, and some massage parlours will be allowed to reopen with restrictions on the number of clients.</p> <p>Thailand had been considered a success story last year for largely containing the virus, though at great economic cost, especially to its tourism sector, because foreign visitors were largely banned from entering the country.</p> <p>So far, about 3.3% of the country’s roughly 69 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The government has secured only 7 million vaccine doses in total.</p> <p>The government has been negotiating to get more supplies that would allow it to fully inoculate about 70% of the population by the end of the year. Its earlier plans would have allowed only about 45% of the population to be inoculated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb7728125c2725aa96cba33c2720fd798293682a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7728125c2725aa96cba33c2720fd798293682a/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shopping mall staff wait to receive the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination centre inside a shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand, today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopping mall staff wait to receive the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination centre inside a shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand, today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diego Azubel/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T09:33:58.688Z\">at 10.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b4a0d88f08d486a77183ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T08:45:07.016Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hong Kong</strong> will offer civil servants who get vaccinated against Covid-19 a day off for each dose, the government said today, as authorities struggle to boost a sluggish innoculation rate among the city’s 7.5 million population. From Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The secretary for the civil service, Patrick Nip, speaking at a press conference, also said the government was in talks with financial institutions, tertiary schools and theme parks to set up innoculation centres for staff to ramp up the vaccination rate.</p> <p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at the briefing she had already sent letters to more than 100 firms urging them to follow in the footsteps of the government’s measures.</p> <p>“From now until the end of August is a crucial time for pandemic prevention,” Lam said. “We’re kicking off the ‘Early Vaccination for All’ campaign today to boost the vaccination rate, in order to achieve herd immunity.”</p> <p>Health secretary Sophia Chan joined her colleagues’ calls for people to get vaccinated, warning that if another wave of coronavirus sweeps the territory those who have not been innoculated could face more restrictions.</p> <p>More than 2.3 million coronavirus vaccines have been administered in Hong Kong, with the lacklustre rate resulting in a surplus of doses that are due to expire as soon as August.</p> <p>Roughly 21% of the population aged 16 and above has had at least one dose, Lam said. The latest move comes as some businesses have already announced steps to lure a hesitant public, with Sino Group, Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Chinese Estates Holdings dangling a new flat worth HK$10.8m (£1m) as the top prize in a vaccine lottery.</p> <p>The government has also relaxed some coronavirus rules for vaccinated people in a bid to encourage inoculations as worries over adverse reactions and a lack of confidence in the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine hamper the vaccination rate.</p> <p>Hong Kong offers both Sinovac and Germany’s BioNTech vaccines and residents can choose.</p> <p>The global financial hub has kept Covid-19 transmission largely under control, recording more than 11,800 cases and 210 deaths, much lower than many other developed cities.</p> <p>While life in Hong Kong has largely returned to normal with schools reopened and restaurants and shopping malls full, the government still limits gatherings outside to no more than four people.</p> <p><a

rate in Bolton currently stands at 386.7 cases per 100,000, down from 452.8 on 21 May, suggesting the recent surge in cases in the town, driven by the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, may have peaked.</p> <p>Bolton shares a border with Blackburn with Darwen, and both areas have reported some of the highest numbers of cases of the Indian variant, with Bolton recording 1,354 up to 25 May -– the highest in the country – and Blackburn with Darwen recording 361.</p> <p>Health teams in both local authorities have been running surge testing for the virus, along with <a

for the vaccine.</p> <p>Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccine programme in Bolton, told BBC Breakfast: </p> <p>“I’m pleased to report that things are starting to slow in terms of the rise here in Covid cases, but we really can’t rest on that.</p> <p>“It’s only been a few days of the rates slowing down so we really are keen to keep pushing forwards and get the rates down further.”</p> <p>Dr Wall said there are very young populations in many of the areas that have seen the highest rises in Bolton, and each time the age comes down for vaccine eligibility, thousands more people are able to come forward for the jab.</p> <p>“I think the age of eligibility going down every few days has really helped, and will really help us, if we can get those people through the doors to be vaccinated asap,” she said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-31T08:21:27.129Z\">at 9.21am BST</time></p>  </div> <div

The government said 700,000 people had been tested through last Wednesday.</p> <p>China had relaxed most restrictions on domestic travel after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control last March. Travellers arriving from abroad still must be tested.</p> <p>On Saturday, residents of one Guangzhou neighbourhood were ordered to stay at home for door-to-door testing. In some areas, outdoor markets and child care facilities were closed and in-person grade school classes and indoor restaurant dining cancelled.</p> <p>China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad.

The decision will mean that the oldest international tournament in the world will go ahead as planned on 13 June, with the final scheduled on 10 July. Reuters reports: The Brazilian government has shown agility and decisive thinking at a crucial moment for South American football,” Conmebol president Alejandro Domínguez said in a statement. “Brazil is in a time of stability; it has proven infrastructure and recent experience in hosting a tournament of this magnitude.” Brazil hosted the Copa America in 2019 and the World Cup in 2014. The decision is a boost for the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who has railed against lockdowns and urged Brazilians to return to everyday life. In a separate tweet, Conmebol thanked Bolsonaro for “opening the country’s doors to what is now the safest sporting event in the world”. The president’s office directed questions to the sports department at the ministry of citizenship, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Turkey has eased further measures meant to curb Covid infections, including partially lifting a weekend lockdown and opening up restaurants to a limited number of guests. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the lighter measures, in response to falling cases, would go into effect on Tuesday, and under the new rules, nationwide daily curfews are delayed by an hour to 10pm, Reuters reports. France’s Covid-19 hospital numbers and new cases have continued falling as the country gradually relaxes restrictions, and its vaccination campaign speeds up. On Monday, France recorded 1,211 new coronavirus cases, down from 2,229 last Monday and the lowest case count since 17 August. The latest figures take the total to over 5.66m. The French health ministry reported 126 new deaths, compared with 62 last Monday and a seven-day moving average of 124. The total death toll now stands at 109,528. They also reported 2,945 people in intensive care units, down by 48 from a day earlier. But on Mondays, the case count usually drops sharply because of weekend reporting lags. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in a tweet he had been vaccinated; however, he did not specify with which vaccine. Hi, I’m Edna Mohamed; I’ll be taking over from Yohannes for the rest of the night. If I miss anything, you can drop me a message on Twitter or email me at edna.mohamed@hotmail.co.uk Here is a quick recap of all the main Covid updates from around the world: The Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, has prolonged partial Covid curbs in the capital and nearby provinces until mid-June to contain infections. Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1-7 June. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer. Reuters reports: Madrid and the central Spanish region of Castilla la Mancha are considering easing rules on wearing face masks outdoors, officials said on Monday, as falling transmission and rising vaccination rates have lowered the risk of Covid-19 infection. Masks have been mandatory indoors and out across most of Spain, regardless of social distancing, since last summer. But daily case numbers and the nationwide infection rate have been declining for months and nearly 40% of the population has received at least one vaccine shot, prompting some authorities to reconsider the rules. “We are firmly determined to abolish the obligation to wear face masks in open spaces ... before (the rule’s) anniversary in July,” Castilla la Mancha’s regional leader, Emiliano García-Page, said in a speech. “We want to do this in concert with the nation,” he said, adding that he would propose the relaxation of the rules to the central government and other regions. The Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, has prolonged partial Covid curbs in the capital and nearby provinces until mid-June to contain infections that have been decreasing since hitting a peak in April. Religious gatherings remain capped at 30% of venue capacity, while dining in restaurants can operate at 20% in the capital region, an urban sprawl of 16 cities that is home to at least 13 million people, and nearby provinces. Non-essential travel will remain prohibited, Reuters reports. Daily coronavirus cases in the Philippines averaged roughly 6,300 for May, down by a third from April, after the government reduced operating capacity of businesses and limited the movement of people. Duterte also extended a ban on inbound travel from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates until 15 June, to prevent transmission of the coronavirus variant first discovered in India. School closures in England during the Covid lockdown badly damaged the mental health of mothers but had no impact on fathers’ wellbeing, research has found. Doing childcare and home schooling as well as their own jobs led to more mothers of pre-teenage children feeling depressed, having trouble sleeping and seeing themselves as worthless. The pandemic increased mental health problems among parents generally. However, mothers bore the brunt, with fathers barely affected, the study found. Closing schools to stop the spread of coronavirus had “a significant detrimental effect” on mothers’ mental health, academics from Essex, Surrey and Birmingham universities said. However, “for fathers it made no difference”. You can read the full story by Denis Campbell, the Guardian’s health policy editor, here: Reuters reports: Portugal’s government said on Monday authorities must learn from their mistakes after a decision to allow thousands of English football fans to party in the streets of Porto for Saturday’s Champions League final prompted criticism from some lawmakers. “Every day, unfortunately, there are people who do not respect the rules, but that doesn’t mean the rules are illegitimate,” prime minister António Costa told reporters, admitting the event “didn’t go perfectly”. “It is clear that what happened this weekend cannot serve as an example, it must serve as a lesson,” Costa said, adding authorities must work to provide more information to tourists about measures they must adopt during their holidays. Earlier the government came under fire from some lawmakers for sending contradictory Covid-19 messages ahead of the match, in which Chelsea beat Manchester City 1-0. In the days leading up to Saturday’s final, big crowds of English fans, largely maskless and not socially distancing, took over Porto’s streets to drink and chant team slogans. One further person has died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Monday, according to the government, bringing the UK total to 127,782. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The government also said that as of 9am on Monday there had been a further 3,383 lab-confirmed cases in the UK, PA Media reports. You can read the official release here. Health ministers in Germany have pledged to clamp down on fraud in coronavirus test centres across the country, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. At an emergency meeting on Monday after German media exposed the anomalies, Jens Spahn, the federal health minister, and representatives from the 16 states agreed to introduce reforms at the 15,000 test centres. Since March, Germans have been able to have at least one free coronavirus test a week, with some states providing one test a day. The national daily test capacity is about 360,000 a day. Test centres receive €18 (£15) for each test carried out. However, as increasing numbers of test centres sprang up around the country, no system was in place to track the number of tests actually done, compared with the numbers submitted by the centres to the government, for which they are quickly reimbursed. Kate Connolly, the Guardian’s Berlin correspondent, has the full story here: Italy reported 82 coronavirus-related deaths on Monday against 44 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections fell to 1,820 from 2,949. The number of patients in hospital with Covid- not including those in intensive care- stood at 6,482 on Monday, down from 6,591 a day earlier, Reuters reports. In France, health authorities reported 2,945 people in intensive care units with Covid-19 on Monday, down by 48 from a day earlier, continuing a virtually uninterrupted fall from a 2021 high of more than 6,000 mid-April. The total number of people in hospital also dropped by a further 179 to 16,596 as the vaccination campaign sped up, Reuters reports. The health ministry also reported 126 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals, after three days with a hospital coronavirus death toll below 100. Denmark’s government has asked the country’s health authorities to reconsider a decision earlier this month to exclude Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid-19 shots from its vaccination programme, local media reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. The media reports by broadcaster TV2 and newspaper Ekstra Bladet also said Denmark’s vaccination programme would be concluded in September, two weeks after the current timeline. The delay is due to delivery of fewer Moderna vaccines than expected, they reported. Denmark was the first country to exclude the J&amp;J vaccine over a potential link to a rare but serious form of blood clot. A spokeswoman for the health ministry could not immediately comment on the reports. Denmark has also stopped using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine altogether, citing similar concerns. Thailand’s government has reversed a decision by authorities in its capital, Bangkok, to ease coronavirus restrictions, as the city battles its worst outbreak of the virus so far, Reuters reports. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) late on Monday said the national coronavirus taskforce had overruled the city’s move to allow massage shops, clinics and parks to reopen from Tuesday. It did not provide a reason. Bangkok and the provinces around it are the epicentre of the two-month-old outbreak, during which the vast majority of Thailand’s coronavirus cases and deaths have been recorded. Massage shops, clinics and public parks must remain closed along with schools, cinemas, gyms and zoos for at least 14 more days. The decision comes as the government faces growing public criticism for a slow and chaotic vaccine rollout, which is due to start on 7 June. Thailand reported 5,485 new cases on Monday, with 1,356 of those in Bangkok. The country also reported 19 new deaths on Monday, bringing its total to 1,031 since the outbreak started. Hello! This is Lucy Campbell, taking over for a short while while Yohannes has a much-deserved break. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for speedily launching global negotiations to agree on an international treaty on pandemic preparedness and response, Reuters reports. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, also told a closing session of its annual week-long ministerial assembly that the UN agency required sustainable and flexible funding. He said: The one recommendation I believe will do the most to strengthen WHO and global health security is the recommendation of a treaty on pandemic preparedness and response which could also strengthen relations between member states and foster cooperation. This is an idea whose time has come. In England, a total of 54,657,957 Covid vaccinations took place between 8 December and 30 May, according to NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 278,637 on the previous day. NHS England said 32,938,496 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 99,213 on the previous day, while 21,719,461 were a second dose, an increase of 179,424, PA Media reports. Hungary’s planned vaccine plant will be fitted out for production of Chinese shots against Covid-19 as well as a local dose, foreign minister Péter Szijjártó has said, according to state news agency MTI. Szijjártó made the announcement after talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and added that the agreement would mean a “great strategic advantage” for Hungary, Reuters reports. An advocacy group has sent a legal letter to the government body charged with protecting England’s public health, warning of a high court challenge unless it immediately publishes data of the spread in schools of the variant first detected in India. The pre-action letter sent by advocacy group, the Citizens, working with AWO, a data rights firm, follows a report in the Observer that Public Health England (PHE) was preparing to publish the data on 13 May but the prime minister’s office intervened and put pressure on it not to do so. The legal letter says the public health body is bound by law to be independent from political interference and warns it faces a judicial review unless it releases the data. It cites PHE’s framework agreement with the Department of Health and Social Care that states it has “operational autonomy” and “shall be free to publish and speak on those issues which relate to the nation’s health and wellbeing in order to set out the professional, scientific and objective judgement of the evidence base”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Boris Johnson are both named as “interested parties” in the proposed claim, to which PHE has seven days to respond. Clara Maguire, the executive director of the Citizens, said: ‘It defies belief that Public Health England is refusing to publish this vital public health data on the spread of the so-called Indian variant in schools despite scientists, teachers, parents and unions all saying that they need it to safeguard theirs and their children’s health. “We believe that there is an immediate risk to life. The public needs this data now and we believe that PHE is acting unlawfully in withholding it. It is unbelievable that a matter of vital importance to our public health can be subject to political interference.” The letter states that PHE had promised stakeholders that the data would be included in reports “on or around 12 May” and that PHE by not then publishing was in “breach of a legitimate expectation”. On Thursday, eight unions wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking for the release of the same data. Update from earlier post on the European Commission proposing that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer: People who have recovered from a Covid-19 infection should be exempt from restrictions for 180 days, Reuters reports. The commission also proposed that more reliable, but more expensive PCR tests should be valid for 72 hours and rapid antigen tests for 48 hours. Children, who are not yet in line for vaccinations, should not have to undergo a quarantine if travelling with parents who are exempt. Those aged six and older can be subject to tests. The proposals, which are being put to EU member states, mirror those already agreed for travel to the EU from outside the bloc. Plans to make Covid documents a requirement of entry to mass events are likely to be dropped as the government grapples with how it can safely lift the final set of restrictions in England within weeks. Ministers have been investigating making coronavirus status certificates compulsory in some settings for months, following the lead of Israel, which introduced a “green pass” for people to demonstrate their low-risk of having or transmitting the disease. As the UK’s vaccination programme continues at greater speed than most countries, questions in Whitehall have focused on how best fully to reopen sectors such as theatres and nightclubs, and restart spectator events including festivals and concerts, without social distancing. But the Guardian has been told that status documents, which would display proof of vaccination, a recent negative test result, or antibodies, are unlikely to be introduced ahead of 21 June – the final stage of Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown when all legal limits on social contact are due to be scrapped. Aubrey Allegretti, a political correspondent for the Guardian, has the full story here: Vietnam is encouraging local governments and companies to import Covid vaccines themselves, the government said, through procurements that would need to be done via the health ministry or through 27 licensed importers. As Reuters reports, the country is grappling with its biggest outbreak so far and has yet to start mass vaccinations. In England, Twickenham Rugby Stadium has been turned into a major walk-in vaccine centre in a drive to try to boost vaccinations against coronavirus as cases of the Indian variant surge. Up to 15,000 first dose jabs are being made available for those in the local area who have not yet been vaccinated, PA Media reports. The event - called Let’s Tackle Covid - aims to increase the number of vaccinations as cases of the Indian coronavirus variant surge in Hounslow, west London. The coronavirus variant of concern first detected in India is continuing to spread across England, with cases emerging beyond “hotspot” areas, data suggests. The variant, known as B.1.617.2, is thought to be driving a rise in Covid cases in parts of the UK and is believed to be both more transmissible than the variant first detected in Kent, which previously dominated, and somewhat more resistant to Covid vaccines, particularly after just one dose. At present up to three-quarters of new Covid cases in the UK are thought to be caused by the India variant. There have also been signs of a slight rise in hospitalisations. The situation has led some scientists to warn that the country is now in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus which, despite the vaccination programme, modelling suggests could lead to a rise in hospitalisations and deaths, and that full easing of restrictions in England on 21 June should be reconsidered. You can read the latest by Nicola Davis, the Guardian’s science correspondent, here: Vietnam has announced the suspension of incoming international flights to its capital and tightened restrictions in its biggest city, Reuters reports. After successfully containing Covid outbreaks for most of last year, Vietnam is seeing infections rise sharply and has detected several highly transmissible variants, including a new one announced on Saturday that had elements of the variants first identified in Britain and India. The inbound flight suspension to Hanoi will apply from 1 June 1 to 7 June. Vietnam has been restricting inbound international flights since the start of the pandemic. It follows a similar move by the business hub Ho Chi Minh City, which on Monday started 15 days of measures that include bans on dining in restaurants and public gatherings of more than 10 people. It has urged people over 60 to stay indoors (see earlier post). Vietnam, a country of 98 million people, has recorded 7,236 Covid infections so far, one of the world’s lowest caseloads. It has reported 47 deaths overall. Travellers from the UK will have to provide “compelling reasons” to enter France from Monday, as French authorities tighten curbs to halt the spread of the Indian Covid variant. Travel to France from the UK will be permitted only for EU nationals, French residents, or those travelling for essential reasons. Those who are allowed to make the journey must take a pre-departure Covid test and quarantine for seven days on arrival. France is listed as an “amber” destination by the UK government, which advises against travel there, with British authorities requiring people to self-isolate for 10 days and take two Covid tests on their return. Last Wednesday, the French government’s official spokesman, Gabriel Attal, said there was “a new situation with the progression of the so-called Indian variant in the UK”, adding that Germany had already imposed strict controls on visitors from Britain and that France was taking “similar measures”. France has today opened up Covid-19 vaccines to all adults, a week before Germany, as Europe races to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants, AFP reports. Until now, French authorities gave priority to people over 50, people in “priority professions” or younger adults with underlying health problems. So far, 25.4 million people have received a first shot of a vaccine, representing about 38% of the population and nearly one in two adults. Nearly 12 million have received the two shots required for full protection. As the French savour a degree of freedom following the reopening of cafes, restaurants and museums two weeks ago, initially high levels of vaccine scepticism have begun to subside. A Cevipof poll conducted in early May showed that 65% of adults planned to get vaccinated, up from 48% in February. “I am fully convinced that we are going to see a lot of people getting vaccinated,” Prof Alain Fischer, the immunologist who heads the government’s vaccination advisory board, said today, adding that immunisation was the key to “getting back an increasingly normal life.” With 28 million adults eligible for a first shot, but only around half a million appointments available each day, many people have opted to travel outside their neighbourhood or even their region to secure highly coveted Pfizer or Moderna shots. Vaccinations with the AstraZeneca and Janssen jabs are open only to those aged 55, after cases of potentially deadly blood clots in a very small number of younger people vaccinated. The government is hoping that the 76.7m vaccines it is expecting to receive in June will help it meet demand. So far the virus has claimed 109,431 lives in France. Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for use in the Palestinian territories, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund has said. The RDIF fund is marketing the Russian vaccine abroad, Reuters reports. Portugal’s economy shrank 3.3% in the first quarter from the preceding three months, as tourism withered due to a tight lockdown imposed in mid-January, official data indicates. To fight a surge in Covid infections in mid-January, which at the time was the deadliest outbreak per capita in the world, the country imposed a strict three-month lockdown, which has since been gradually lifted. Statistics agency INE said, in its second reading, that gross domestic product shrank 5.4% from the first quarter last year when the country’s first lockdown did not take effect until mid-March. As Reuters reports, Portugal’s economy, in which the tourism sector represented about 15% of GDP before the pandemic hit, shrank 7.6% in 2020, its biggest annual slump since 1936. The European Commission has proposed that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer, as the number of Covid vaccinations continues to grow and the severity of the pandemic in the bloc diminishes, Reuters reports. The EU executive, which is seeking to harmonise travel measures across the bloc, said that – according to its recommendation – fully vaccinated people should be exempt from testing or quarantines when travelling from one EU country to another. Reuters reports: India’s Serum Institute will increase production of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines by nearly 40% in June, officials said on Monday, in the first step towards alleviating a shortage that has worsened the country’s battle with coronavirus. The world’s second most-populous nation has struggled with a catastrophic outbreak of Covid-19 since last month which is only now starting to abate after killing tens of thousands of people. Government officials and experts say the only way India can avoid a third wave of infections is by having most of its 1.3 billion population inoculated. The Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest manufacturer of vaccines, will make 90 million doses of AstraZeneca in June from about 65 million a month now, a company spokesman told Reuters. Most of the shots administered in India are AstraZeneca, but local firm Bharat Biotech also plans to ramp up production of its Covaxin vaccine to 23 million in June from about 10 million in April, a government official said. Covid curbs may not be eased further next week in parts of Scotland where infections are rising, the health secretary has warned. Areas in level 2 are scheduled to move down to level 1 on 7 June. However, according to Humza Yousaf, this may not be possible for areas where coronavirus cases are giving “cause for concern”. He said this could affect locations outside Glasgow, which is the only part of Scotland that remains in level 3. Speaking to the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme, Yousaf said: It may not be the entire country moving to level one. I think people would understand where there are rising case numbers, where there is rising test positivity … it may be the case that parts of the country move to level one but actually other parts of the country we decide to keep in level 2. Asked if he was referring to Glasgow, he replied: “Glasgow – but also, I must be quite frank, there are other parts from the data that continue to give us cause for concern.” This has been shared by Edouard Mathieu, head of data at Our World in Data: The 21 June target for scrapping England’s remaining coronavirus restrictions appears increasingly under threat, as a senior government adviser said the country was in the early stages of a third wave. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been “exponential growth” in new cases, with the variant first detected in India accounting for three-quarters. Asked if the third wave had begun, Gupta replied: “Yes.” He added: Of course, the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment – all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive – so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave. It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a false sense of security for some time, and that’s our concern.

As always, feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Thailand today reported a record number of new coronavirus cases as the governor of Bangkok announced an easing of some restrictions in effect for more than a month – including people visiting parks for exercise. From AP: Thailand has been fighting to deal with a virus surge that began in early April in a group of nightclubs in Bangkok and has since spread around the country. The Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration reported a record 5,485 new cases, of which 1,953 were in prisons. Confirmed deaths increased by 19 to bring the total to 1,031 since the pandemic began last year. The total number of confirmed cases has now risen to 159,792, of which 82% occurred during the latest surge. Many of the cases are concentrated in prisons, housing for construction workers, factories, slums and low-income housing areas. Officials have in some cases been criticised for allowing companies to isolate and quarantine workers inside factories. Bangkok, which has been a hot spot in the outbreak, reported 1,356 of the cases on Monday. CCSA deputy spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangsan said the capital has 45 clusters to deal with. Bangkok will slightly ease its lockdown measures starting tomorrow. In addition to reopening parks and botanical gardens, the city will allow limited numbers of visitors to museums, science parks, historical monuments, ancient places and art centres. Schools, bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues will remain closed, but tattoo parlours, nail salons, beauty and weight loss clinics, and some massage parlours will be allowed to reopen with restrictions on the number of clients. Thailand had been considered a success story last year for largely containing the virus, though at great economic cost, especially to its tourism sector, because foreign visitors were largely banned from entering the country. So far, about 3.3% of the country’s roughly 69 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The government has secured only 7 million vaccine doses in total. The government has been negotiating to get more supplies that would allow it to fully inoculate about 70% of the population by the end of the year. Its earlier plans would have allowed only about 45% of the population to be inoculated. Hong Kong will offer civil servants who get vaccinated against Covid-19 a day off for each dose, the government said today, as authorities struggle to boost a sluggish innoculation rate among the city’s 7.5 million population. From Reuters: The secretary for the civil service, Patrick Nip, speaking at a press conference, also said the government was in talks with financial institutions, tertiary schools and theme parks to set up innoculation centres for staff to ramp up the vaccination rate. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at the briefing she had already sent letters to more than 100 firms urging them to follow in the footsteps of the government’s measures. “From now until the end of August is a crucial time for pandemic prevention,” Lam said. “We’re kicking off the ‘Early Vaccination for All’ campaign today to boost the vaccination rate, in order to achieve herd immunity.” Health secretary Sophia Chan joined her colleagues’ calls for people to get vaccinated, warning that if another wave of coronavirus sweeps the territory those who have not been innoculated could face more restrictions. More than 2.3 million coronavirus vaccines have been administered in Hong Kong, with the lacklustre rate resulting in a surplus of doses that are due to expire as soon as August. Roughly 21% of the population aged 16 and above has had at least one dose, Lam said. The latest move comes as some businesses have already announced steps to lure a hesitant public, with Sino Group, Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation and Chinese Estates Holdings dangling a new flat worth HK$10.8m (£1m) as the top prize in a vaccine lottery. The government has also relaxed some coronavirus rules for vaccinated people in a bid to encourage inoculations as worries over adverse reactions and a lack of confidence in the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine hamper the vaccination rate. Hong Kong offers both Sinovac and Germany’s BioNTech vaccines and residents can choose. The global financial hub has kept Covid-19 transmission largely under control, recording more than 11,800 cases and 210 deaths, much lower than many other developed cities. While life in Hong Kong has largely returned to normal with schools reopened and restaurants and shopping malls full, the government still limits gatherings outside to no more than four people. Critics of the rules say they are aimed at preventing a repeat of anti-government street protests that rocked the former British colony in 2019. The rise in Covid-19 cases in Bolton, north-west England, where cases had soared giving it the highest infection rate in the country, is slowing down but there is no room for complacency, a senior doctor has warned (via PA Media). The seven-day rate in Bolton currently stands at 386.7 cases per 100,000, down from 452.8 on 21 May, suggesting the recent surge in cases in the town, driven by the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, may have peaked. Bolton shares a border with Blackburn with Darwen, and both areas have reported some of the highest numbers of cases of the Indian variant, with Bolton recording 1,354 up to 25 May -– the highest in the country – and Blackburn with Darwen recording 361. Health teams in both local authorities have been running surge testing for the virus, along with “surge vaccinations” to boost take-up among everyone who is eligible for the vaccine. Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccine programme in Bolton, told BBC Breakfast: “I’m pleased to report that things are starting to slow in terms of the rise here in Covid cases, but we really can’t rest on that. “It’s only been a few days of the rates slowing down so we really are keen to keep pushing forwards and get the rates down further.” Dr Wall said there are very young populations in many of the areas that have seen the highest rises in Bolton, and each time the age comes down for vaccine eligibility, thousands more people are able to come forward for the jab. “I think the age of eligibility going down every few days has really helped, and will really help us, if we can get those people through the doors to be vaccinated asap,” she said. China today reimposed anti-coronavirus travel controls on its southern province of Guangdong, announcing anyone leaving the populous region must be tested for the virus following a spike in infections that has alarmed authorities, the Associated Press reports. Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, recorded 20 new confirmed cases, all contracted locally, in the 24 hours through to midnight yesterday. Guangdong’s numbers are low compared with many places in the world, but the rise has rattled Chinese leaders who thought they had the disease under control. People leaving Guangdong by plane, train, bus or private car after 10pm today must present results of a nucleic acid test within the past 72 hours, the provincial government announced. It said testing stations for truck drivers would be set up on major roads. The government of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, a business centre of 15 million people, ordered mass testing after locally acquired infections were found beginning 21 May. The government said 700,000 people had been tested through last Wednesday. China had relaxed most restrictions on domestic travel after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control last March. Travellers arriving from abroad still must be tested. On Saturday, residents of one Guangzhou neighbourhood were ordered to stay at home for door-to-door testing. In some areas, outdoor markets and child care facilities were closed and in-person grade school classes and indoor restaurant dining cancelled. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,099 confirmed cases. Hello, this is Haroon Siddique. I’ll be updating the blog for the next few hours. Burkina Faso, one of several countries in Africa that has yet to launch a Covid-19 vaccination campaign, received its first shipment under the global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax yesterday, Reuters reports, citing the country’s health ministry. The 115,200 AstraZeneca doses were flown into the airport of the capital Ouagadougou and were welcomed by a local delegation led by health minister Charlemagne Ouedraogo. “In a few weeks other vaccines will probably arrive to supplement what we have,” Ouedraogo said. The vaccination campaign, which will first target health workers, aims to eventually inoculate over 15 million of the west African nation’s 21.5 million citizens, the ministry said. Some 1.5bn Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally, but only about 1% of them in Africa, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) found. Earlier in May, Burkina Faso was one of a few African countries, including Tanzania and Chad, highlighted by the International Rescue Committee as not having administered a single dose while richer countries had ordered excess supply. The Covax facility, backed by the WHO and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), aims to secure 2bn vaccine doses for lower-income countries by the end of 2021. That’s it from me, Helen Livingstone, for today. Here’s a summary of what’s been happening: Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the US, has told the Guardian it is too early to declare victory against Covid-19 as cases fall in the country to the lowest rates since last June. “We don’t want to declare victory prematurely because we still have a ways to go,” he said. Japan is considering requiring negative Covid-19 test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported, as a poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. The acting premier of the Australian state of Victoria, currently enduring a seven-day lockdown, has warned that the situation remains “incredibly serious” as the region posted 11 new cases of Covid, including some involving aged care homes. “I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better,” James Merlino said. India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 11 April at 152,734 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,128. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, wants the upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics. “We’ve got to do better than this,” he told Canadian broadcaster CBC. In the UK, ministers will adopt a cautious approach in deciding whether to ease lockdown on 21 June, with hospitals already under pressure and health experts warning against “charging ahead”. A health expert affiliated with the World Health Organization has called on the US to share any intelligence it has about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak with the WHO and the scientific community. Vietnam is planning to test all 9 million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and has imposed more restrictions to deal with a growing Covid-19 outbreak. Vietnam is planning to test all 9 million people in its largest city for the coronavirus and has imposed more restrictions to deal with a growing Covid-19 outbreak, the Associated Press reports. People in Ho Chi Minh city are only allowed to leave home for necessary activities and public gatherings of more than 10 people are banned for the next two weeks, the government has announced. The city, Vietnam’s economic hub, also shut down non-essential business on Thursday when cases started to increase. State newspaper Vietnam News said the city authority is planning to test its entire population with a testing capacity of 100,000 samples a day. The newspaper also said police had filed a case on Sunday against a couple who head a Protestant church mission for “spreading dangerous infectious diseases,” citing poor health protocols applied at the premises. At least 145 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported with links to the Revival Ekklesia Mission, a Protestant sect, and the city district of Go Vap, where the church is based, has been locked down. Vietnam has since banned all religious events nationwide. The newspaper said church followers gathered in small space for singing and chanting without proper distancing and mask wearing. Ho Chi Minh city police said the mission has 48 registered members. Here’s an update on Japan’s potential plan to require fans at the Tokyo Olympics to provide proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test from our correspondent Justin McCurry: China has reported a sudden surge of Covid cases in the country’s south, with 20 new local cases on Sunday, Reuters reports, as authorities lock down areas of Guangdong province’s capital city. Of the 27 new coronavirus cases reported by the national health authority in its daily updates, only seven infections were imported, with the remainder originating in Guangdong province. On Saturday, authorities placed a neighbourhood in the capital city of Guangzhou under lockdown as a precautionary measure to curb the virus’ spread. State media reports have suggested that the the recent outbreak is linked to a strain of the virus originating in India. In a Guardian interview, Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the US, has warned it is too early to declare victory against Covid-19 as cases fall in the country to the lowest rates since last June. “We don’t want to declare victory prematurely because we still have a ways to go,” Fauci said. “But the more and more people that can get vaccinated, as a community, the community will be safer and safer.” Daily coronavirus cases have dropped 53% since 1 May, according to Johns Hopkins University data, but the rates are still high in the unvaccinated population and cases are growing globally. Already there have been more global cases in 2021 than in all of 2020, according to Johns Hopkins University data. “As long as there is some degree of activity throughout the world, there’s always a danger of variants emerging and diminishing somewhat the effectiveness of our vaccines,” said Fauci. The Australian state of Victoria, currently enduring a seven-day lockdown, has reported 11 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the current number of active cases in the area to 54. Worryingly, three of those cases are related to aged care homes, which bore the brunt of last year’s outbreak in Victoria, in which hundreds of elderly care home residents died. Acting state premier James Merlino told reporters on Monday the situation was “incredibly serious” and that “the next few days remain critical.” “I want to be very clear with everyone, this outbreak may well get worse before it gets better,” he said. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, wants the upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics, Reuters reports. “We need to have agreements on issues such as vaccine passports, Covid status certification and the rest,” Johnson told the Canadian public channel CBC. Johnson was speaking ahead of a 11-13 June summit of the G7 economic powers (US, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy) which he will host in Cornwall, at the southwestern tip of England. “What we need, I think, is a global treaty on pandemic preparedness,” he said, adding that 2020 had been a “terrible year for humanity.” Johnson said it was also a bad time “for believers in global cooperation, because the world simply became balkanized,” with many countries slow to share stocks of protective equipment, medicines and vaccines. “We’ve got to do better than this,” the prime minister added. “Vaccination has got to be a global enterprise,” Johnson said in the interview taped on Friday and broadcast on Sunday. He said it was crucial that developing countries receive vaccine supplies as quickly as possible. Rather than the goal set by some of vaccinating the world by 2024 or 2025, Johnson set a more ambitious target, saying, “We need to get this done by the end of next year.” India has reported its lowest daily rise in new coronavirus infections since 11 April at 152,734 cases over the past 24 hours, while deaths rose by 3,128, according to Reuters. The South Asian nation’s tally of infections now stands at 28 million, while the death toll has reached 329,100, health ministry data shows. And in a slightly lighter twist on Covid news from India, this great picture from Hyderabad shows a man wearing headgear inspired by the virus and who is employed by a private hospital to counsel local residents about Covid safety measures. Japan is considering requiring negative Covid-19 test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported according to Reuters, as a new poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. With the opening of the Games less than two months away, public confidence has been shaken by a fourth wave of coronavirus infections and a slow vaccination rollout. Foreign spectators have already been banned and game organisers are expected to make a decision next month on whether Japanese fans will be able to attend and, if so, under what conditions. In addition to other coronavirus measures like banning loud cheering and high-fives, the Yomiuri said the government was considering whether spectators should be required to show a negative test result taken within a week of attending an Olympic event. The report was met with outrage among some social media users, with thousands of tweets criticising the country’s continued push to host the Olympics in the middle of a pandemic. The term “negative test certificate” was trending on Twitter in Japan, garnering over 8,000 tweets on Monday morning. In a poll published by the Nikkei paper on Monday, over 60% of respondents were in favour of cancelling or delaying the Games, a result in line with previous polls by other media outlets. Hello and welcome to today’s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Livingstone. Japan is considering requiring negative test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper has reported, as a new poll showed public opposition to the Games remains strong. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has told Canadian broadcaster CBC he wants an upcoming Group of Seven summit to reach agreement on Covid-19 vaccine passports and to open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics. And Victoria has confirmed 11 new locally acquired coronavirus cases, including four relating to aged care homes, bringing the total number of active cases in the Australian state, to 54. You can follow our live coverage on the Victorian lockdown here. Here’s a roundup of what’s been happening over the weekend: In the UK, ministers will adopt a cautious approach in deciding whether to ease lockdown on June 21, with hospitals already under pressure and health experts warning against “charging ahead”. Scientists have warned ministers that a third wave of coronavirus may have already begun in Britain, casting doubt on plans in England to lift all lockdown restrictions in three weeks’ time. A health expert affiliated with the World Health Organization has called on the US to share any intelligence it has about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak with the WHO and the scientific community. Authorities in Vietnam have detected a new coronavirus variant that is a combination of the Covid variants first identified in India and the UK and spreads quickly by air, the health minister has said. Egypt will lift restrictions it imposed earlier this month to curb the spread the coronavirus, including early closure of shops and restaurants, from June 1, the cabinet said. South Africa has extended its nightly curfew and limited the number of people at gatherings to slow the spread of Covid-19 as positive cases surge, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Sunday. Only 1% of the 1.3 billion vaccines injected around the world have been administered in Africa – and that comparative percentage has been declining in recent weeks. It is a stark figure that underlines just how serious a problem global vaccine inequity has become. But the answer for the developing world is not as simple as delivering more vaccines. Italy has extended an entry ban for people coming from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as a continued precaution against the more transmissible Indian variant.

UK citizens registered as living in France, Malta, Luxembourg and Latvia have until 30 June to apply to secure their post-Brexit rights. The Netherlands did have the same deadline, but on Monday extended it to 1 October. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, UK citizens who were legally resident in one of the EU’s 27 member states at the end of the transition period on 31 December last year are eligible for permanent residence, protecting their basic rights. Fourteen countries, including Spain, Germany, Portugal and Italy, opted for systems that automatically confer a new post-Brexit residence status on legally resident Britons, with no risk of losing rights if any administrative deadline is missed. The other 13, however, operate systems under which UK nationals must formally apply for their new residence status, including the four who set an earlier cutoff date of 30 June. “That’s only a month to go before a hard deadline, after which a lot of people could lose their rights,” said Michaela Benson, a professor of public sociology at Lancaster University, who has specialised in studying British residents in the EU. “We urgently need more communication – from the UK, the EU and member states – to get in touch, especially with hard-to-reach, vulnerable UK citizens who risk missing a vital cutoff point.” Benson said the people at risk of “falling through the gaps” were often the most vulnerable. “Those who have stayed off the radar for whatever reason – maybe because they couldn’t prove they were lawfully resident when they had to,” she said. “The ones to worry about are those who are just scraping by, perhaps in remote areas. They are not likely to come forward of their own accord. There will also be homeless British people, sick British people, British children in care.” According to the EU/UK joint committee on citizens’ rights, whose latest report, dated 28 April, was released on Friday, an estimated 298,000 Britons live in the 13 countries with so-called constitutive systems. Only 190,000 have applied for their new status. In the four countries with a June deadline, 25,500 of France’s estimated 148,000 British residents have yet to register, nearly 800 Britons still have to apply in Latvia, 1,700 in Luxembourg and 5,300 in Malta. In the Netherlands, 3,000 have yet to apply before the new 1 October date, along with 12,000 in Finland and Sweden, which have 30 September deadlines. The cutoff date in Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Slovenia is 31 December. Benson said the figures were approximate since most were based on data from 2018 and some EU states, such as France, had never required EU residents to register with authorities in order to qualify for public services, so may have significantly underestimated. “That means it may well have many more British residents than it imagines, just as the UK had many more EU residents than it thought,” she said. “It also makes it much harder to reach them than in places like the Netherlands with up-to-date registers.” According to the EU’s post-Brexit guidance, “failure to apply in time … may lead to a loss of any entitlement under the withdrawal agreement” in countries with constitutive systems, including the right to continue living in them. According to the committee’s report, an estimated 762,000 UK citizens live in EU countries with automatic – or “declaratory” – systems for post-Brexit residence status, and nearly 165,000 have registered so far. Several of these 14 countries also have deadlines for UK residents to register for their new status, but those who do not face a fine rather than loss of rights.","charCount":"3852","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/jonhenley\">Jon Henley</a> Europe correspondent"},{"headline":"Naomi Osaka withdraws from French Open amid row over press conferences","standfirst":"<ul><li>World No 2 pulls out of event after being fined by organisers</li><li>Osaka says speaking to press causes her ‘huge anxiety’</li></ul>","trailText":"Naomi Osaka has announced her withdrawal from the French Open, a day after being fined and warned over her absence from press conferences","byline":"Guardian sport","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d44834d835fd0faf273b0c17a69043acf62aa83b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d44834d835fd0faf273b0c17a69043acf62aa83b/0_337_4374_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Osaka has announced on Twitter that she is withdrawing from the French Open.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Osaka has announced on Twitter that she is withdrawing from the French Open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TPN/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Naomi Osaka has announced her withdrawal from the French Open, the day after the world No 2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/30/french-open-womens-singles-naomi-osaka-patricia-tig\">was fined $15,000</a> (£10,570) for refusing to attend press conferences.</p> <p>The four-times grand slam champion announced last week that she would not carry out media duties in Paris due to their effects on her mental health.

In hard-hitting words as part of a declaration of a day of remembrance for the hundreds of Black victims of the 1921 mass killing in Oklahoma, Biden used unusually strong language to describe America’s history of racial strife. “On this solemn centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I call on the American people to reflect on the deep roots of racial terror in our nation and recommit to the work of rooting out systemic racism across our country,” Biden said in a statement. Between 31 May and 1 June, white mobs attacked the historical Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma, an area so prosperous and successful it was known as the “Black Wall Street”. They killed an estimated 300 residents, displaced many more and burnt many blocks of the city to the ground. Though it was one of the worst acts of racial violence in US history, its anniversary has seemingly gone little marked by much of America, until anti-racism protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd triggered a reckoning over racism in America. In the statement Biden said that the federal government had played in keeping white and Black Americans unequal in the decades after the massacre by policies that had segregated the races and favored whites. “The federal government must reckon with and acknowledge the role that it has played in stripping wealth and opportunity from Black communities,” he said, while pledging to invest in Black communities and businesses with government programs, including a massive planned infrastructure package as the US builds back from the coronavirus pandemic. “We honor the legacy of the Greenwood community, and of Black Wall Street, by reaffirming our commitment to advance racial justice through the whole of our government, and working to root out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, and our hearts,” he said. Events related to the massacre commemoration ahead of the 100 year anniversary have already begun. Hundreds gathered on Monday for an interfaith service dedicating a prayer wall outside historic Vernon African Methodist Episcopal Church in Tulsa’s Greenwood neighborhood on the centennial of the first day of one of the deadliest racist massacres in the nation. National civil rights leaders, including the Revs Jesse Jackson and William Barber, joined multiple local faith leaders offering prayers and remarks outside the church that was largely destroyed during the massacre. Barber, a civil and economic rights activist, said he was “humbled even to stand on this holy ground”. “You can kill the people but you cannot kill the voice of the blood.” Although the church was nearly destroyed in the massacre, parishioners continued to meet in the basement, and it was rebuilt several years later, becoming a symbol of the resilience of Tulsa’s Black community. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. As the ceremony came to an end, participants put their hands on the prayer wall along the side of the sanctuary while a soloist sung Lift Every Voice and Sing. Traffic hummed on a nearby interstate that cuts through the Greenwood district, which was rebuilt after the massacre but slowly deteriorated 50 years later after homes were taken by eminent domain as part of urban renewal in the 1970s. . The commemoration is slated to include a visit by Biden on Tuesday and the unveiling of the $20m Greenwood Rising museum.","charCount":"3600","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/edwardhelmore\">Edward Helmore</a>"},{"headline":"Gareth Bale declines to deny reports he could retire after Euro 2020","standfirst":"<ul><li>Wales captain insists he wants to focus solely on tournament</li><li>Bale says he wants to avoid more chaos, drama or distraction</li></ul>","trailText":"Gareth Bale has cast doubt over his future after twice declining the opportunity to deny reports he could retire after the European Championship finals this summer","byline":"Ben Fisher","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96e8698c203aa69e471627202753dd5d8c49ae41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96e8698c203aa69e471627202753dd5d8c49ae41/8_70_2823_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gareth Bale during a Wales training session on Monday.

Last week Bale’s agent, Jonathan Barnett, labelled as “rubbish” a report in the Spanish daily ABC that his client could retire. The 31-year-old is under contract at Real Madrid until the end of next season on a deal worth about £600,000 a week. But the Wales captain, who has just finished a loan at Tottenham, refused to deny he could call it a day after Euro 2020. “Obviously there’s been a lot of things written about whether I’m doing this and doing that,” Bale said. “For me, the main thing is I don’t want to say anything that’s going to cause more chaos or more drama or cause a distraction. I just want to focus on the Euros. I don’t want to say anything that is going to cause any problems on what I am doing or what I am not doing. When the Euros finishes for us then I will sit down and decide what I want to do.” Asked to clear up whether he is considering retirement, Bale chuckled and replied: “Yeah, well. It’s one of those.

Skirting between representations of various stages of Dylan’s career (including his combative press conferences and his transition to electric guitar) there is little to hold on to in this slippery and intentionally patchy film, which sees itself as a kind of funhouse mirror reflecting aspects of its subject’s life, aspiring for creative “truth” rather than anything factual. For more Dylan goodness, track down a copy of the 2003 dystopian drama Masked and Anonymous, starring and co-written (under a pseudonym) by Bob himself. Honourable mentions: Killing Eve (TV, 1 June), Moonlight, The Big Sick (films, 1 June); This Is Port Adelaide (film, 4 June); Stranger than Fiction (film, 8 June); The Ninth Gate (film, 9 June); I am Bolt (film, 11 June); The Sum of Us, 1408 (films, 12 June); The Republic of Sarah (TV, 15 June); The Mist (film, 16 June); Logan Lucky (film, 22 June); Requiem for a Dream (film, 23 June); Death Proof (film, 25 June); Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo, Paper Giants: Magazine Wars (TV, 25 June) Amazon Prime Video Whiplash Film, USA, 2014 – out 15 June “Not quite my tempo!” Who could forget JK Simmons’ Oscar-winning performance as a cantankerous teacher at a prestigious music school, where a 19-year-old drummer (Miles Teller) will do anything to succeed, including bleeding all over his drum set? Simmons surely interpreted the role as an opportunity to transport the vein-bulging rage of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket into a film about the pursuit of artistic greatness. Why not warm up for it by revisiting this classic sequence, featuring dialogue such as “you’re rushing”, “you’re dragging” and “why do you suppose I just hurled a chair at your head?” Head Above Water TV, Australia, 2021 – out 4 June Prime Video has previously explored Australian sporting prowess on the cricket ground (The Test: A New Era for Australia’s Team) and the footy field (Making their Mark). Now they dip their toes into the swimming pool, looking at pressures encountered in the world of elite swimming – drawing on the careers of athletes including Ian Thorpe, Bronte Campbell and Kyle Chalmers. Thorpe in particular has previously spoken lucidly about his struggles with mental health. Honourable mentions: Jurassic Park 1, 2 and 3, The Dish (films, 1 June); Pixels (film, 10 June); Almost Famous, Ricki and the Flash, The Wolf of Wall Street, Our Friend (films, 15 June); Freaky (film, 24 June); Antebellum (film, 30 June) Binge Betty season 2 TV, USA, 2021 – out 12 June The first season of Betty had energy and sass from the get-go, following the titular character and her skater girl friends as they hang out, chew the fat and grind and flip a-plenty during summer in New York. It’s sprinkled with graceful visual touches; for instance, I love the creative ways the show displays its title – including through graffiti in the first episode and letters written using ice-cream in the second. The acting, writing, direction has a coolness that seems totally effortless, which of course makes it even cooler. The crew (including director ) return for another six episodes. Kung fu TV, USA, 2021 – out 3 June A rare example of an American network TV show that features a predominantly Asian cast, this martial arts series remakes the popular 70s show of the same name, famously starring David Carradine as a half-white, half-Chinese monk. Now the lead is Asian American actor Olivia Liang, who plays Nicky Shen, a law school dropout cum vigilante who fights gangsters in San Francisco in an attempt to clean up the streets. Honourable mentions: The Wolf of Wall Street (film, 1 June); Oslo (film, 2 June); Breeders season 2 (TV, 3 June); Kill Bill vol 1 and vol 2 (films, 4 June); Doubt (film, 12 June); Tenet (film, 16 June, also on Netflix); The Secret Garden (film, 18 June); Clerks (film, 20 June); Lord of the Rings trilogy (film, 24 June) SBS On Demand The Unusual Suspects TV, Australia, 2021 – out 3 June Described by SBS as “the first major representation of Filipino-Australians on Australian television”, this female-led series from creator Jessica Redenbach is a tough one to get a grip on tonally: as a drama it can be quite funny; as a comedy it’s pretty serious. It’s also a crime story involving the theft of a very expensive necklace. I’m two episodes in and the elements haven’t quite synched yet – though it’s enjoyable and the characters are growing on me. They include Sara “I’m goopier than Gwyneth” Beasley (Miranda Otto), a love-to-hate influencer, and her family’s longsuffering nanny Evie (Aina Dumlao). The Infinite Man Film, Australia, 2014 – out 1 June Writer/director Hugh Sullivan’s terrifically written and directed chamber piece – a wonderfully demented and emotionally upfront time-travel romcom – never quite got the kudos it deserved, though I certainly sang its praises. A lovesick scientist Dean (Josh McConville) invents a time travelling device to try to recreate the perfect weekend away with his girlfriend Lana (Hannah Marshall). Things don’t go to plan, however, resulting in multiple versions of themselves (plus Alex Dimitriades as Lana’s ex-boyfriend) stumbling around a decrepit hotel in the middle of nowhere, with varying degrees of comprehension as to the, shall we say, unique nature of their circumstances. Honourable mentions: Burning Man, Yoga Hosers, Dredd (film, 1 June); Halt and Catch Fire, seasons one to four, Guilt, Red Light (TV, 10 June); Animal Kingdom (film, 11 June); Taxi Driver (film, 12 June); The Act (TV, 17 June); Alex &amp; Eve (film, 17 June); Jindabyne (film, 18 June); Paris Police 1900 (TV, 24 June) ABC iView Jack Irish TV, Australia, 2021 – out 13 June After three TV movies and two series, released in 2016 and 2018, Guy Pearce reprises his role as one of Australian television’s all-time greatest gumshoes for a final hurrah. The down-in-the-mouth detective is called in to surveil a shady character after an off-duty police officer is gunned down at a burger joint in Coburg, Melbourne. The job will be “a piece of piss, even for you”, according to Shane Jacobson’s pie-eating cop Barry, but of course the opposite is true, the plot soon plonking him into various life-threatening scenarios. This classic Australian series has been a class act from the beginning, buoyed up by tight and twisty scripts, a cracking pace and Pearce’s irresistible performance. Starstruck TV, UK, 2021 – out 23 June What a delight! Those words apply equally to New Zealand comedian Rose Matafeo (recently on screens in Baby Done) and to her new show itself, a moreish six-part series that teases out a “will they or won’t they” romantic premise over its entire arc. In the first episode Jessie (Matafeo), who lives in east London with her bestie Kate (Emma Sidi) has a one-night stand with a man, Tom (Nikesh Patel), who she subsequently realises is a massive movie star. The tension between them – sexual and otherwise – feels totally genuine: a result of strongly written and performed characters who are very relatable (even Tom). There are several laugh-out-loud moments and you really, really want the two leads to get together. Director Karen Maine and her writers also make an interesting point: that finding true love isn’t just about locating the “right” person but also encountering them during accommodating circumstances. Honourable mentions: Sherpa (film, 1 June), Hinterland, London Spy, Fresh Meat seasons 1-4 (TV, 1 June); Superwog season 2 (TV, 13 June); Finding the Archibald (TV, 15 June); Black Mirror season 4 (TV, 26 June) Disney+ Loki TV, USA, 2021 – out 9 June After conquering blockbuster cinema a new deluge of Marvel Cinematic Universe TV shows has well and truly begun, with Loki arriving after The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and WandaVision, and before Hawkeye and Ms Marvel. Tom Hiddleston plays the titular character – Thor’s impish adopted brother, who is the “God of Mischief” – in a series that takes place after the events in Avengers: Endgame, involving time travel and alternate realities. Luca Film, USA, 2021 – out 18 June Any new film from Pixar is a cultural event – and of particular interest when they’re original properties (rather than sequels). Based in a picturesque seaside town on the Italian Riviera, Luca is a characteristically glossy and tactile-looking animation about a young boy who is actually a sea monster, pretending to be human. So: another story about an otherworldly whippersnapper trying to fit in with boring old humans (see also: Pinocchio, Ponyo and this month’s Sweet Tooth). Honourable mentions: Raya and the Last Dragon (film, 4 June); Love Simon (film, 11 June); The Simpsons season 31, Love, Victor season 2 (TV, 18 June); The Mysterious Benedict Society, Pride (TV, 25 June), Wolfgang (film, 25 June)","charCount":"12547","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/luke-buckmaster\">Luke Buckmaster</a>"},{"headline":"Romeo and Juliet remixed: how technology can change storytelling","standfirst":"<p>With the touch of a button, a Sydney Opera House audience rewrites Shakespeare as it is performed in front of them</p>","trailText":"With the touch of a button, a Sydney Opera House audience rewrites Shakespeare as it is performed in front of them","byline":"Dan Dixon","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f13e1167ca7f8ea430d168113cb184994dcdb6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f13e1167ca7f8ea430d168113cb184994dcdb6c3/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"R+J RMX, a “remixed” version of Romeo and Juliet, is performed at the Sydney Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">R+J RMX, a “remixed” version of Romeo and Juliet, at the Sydney Opera House in May 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prudence Upton</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>On Sunday, as part of the Sydney Opera House’s UnWrapped series, a group of dancers “remixed” Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet by way of an Australian storytelling technology, Omelia.

The shortage of semi-conductors across the globe has resulted in supply issues for everything from computers, phones and gaming consoles to new cars. Last week Acer announced a new series of gaming laptops, notebooks, and Chromebooks, due to be on shelves starting in the second half of this year, despite Acer’s co-chief operating officer Tiffany Huang telling Guardian Australia the company was struggling to source enough chips for its products. “It will continue to be slow until the first quarter or second quarter of next year,” she said, adding that the pandemic had been fuelling the shortage with so many people working from home. “We have a severe shortage, and it’s not simply just to make sure every family has a device to use, every person has to have a device for working or education. “On any day I can only fill 50% of the worldwide demand.” Huang said that had forced the company to put more resources into its education product portfolio, over its growing gaming portfolio. “We shipped millions of education devices last year [and] this year. That is simply because we believe people really deserve a right to be able to continue their living and learning.” Analyst firm Gartner has backed Acer’s assessment, estimating in its latest report that the shortage would continue until at least the second quarter of 2022, with prices for some devices to increase as a result, while smaller companies will be squeezed by higher prices on chips from suppliers. “We are at the most serious shortage, or the tip, right now,” said Gartner’s senior principal analyst on semi-conductors, Ben Lee. “For some different components, they have had prices rise in the past two or three quarters. “It means the customer has to pay more because there aren’t as many items, especially hot items like mobile PC, and tablets to some extent.” Acer is seeking to boost its green credentials as part of its wider environmental commitments, including getting to 100% renewable energy by 2035. The company announced a new “enviro-friendly” laptop, the Vero, containing 50% post-consumer recycled plastic in its keyboard caps, and about 30% in other parts, such as the top and bottom cover and screen bezels. Huang said it required an overhaul of the manufacturing process with Acer’s supplier. “They have to try so much to measure the temperature, the pressure, [to get] the material perfect. Otherwise, it’s very easy to be more crispy … it’s not easy, so it takes time to get here.” The device also has a focus on the right to repair, she said, with memory and storage easy to upgrade, and no special tools required to make the repairs. “If you want to upgrade you can do it on your own, if you have a common tool in your home,” she said. The laptop has an 11th-generation Intel Core processor, Intel Iris X graphics, and up to 1TB of storage. It will not be available in Australia until later this year and, while pricing is not yet known, Huang indicated it would cost more than the company’s other products, but that Acer aimed not to make the price difference a deterrent.","charCount":"3293","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/josh-taylor\">Josh Taylor</a>"},{"headline":"‘It’s the journey, not the destination’: cycling writer rolls out on 4,900km odyssey","standfirst":"<p>Journalist Rupert Guinness has set off on a remarkable endurance ride to raise awareness about mental health and wellbeing</p>","trailText":"Journalist Rupert Guinness has set off on a remarkable endurance ride to raise awareness about mental health and wellbeing","byline":"Kieran Pender","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2548ba9e511f44f0a335302b21cd206da1c4feb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2548ba9e511f44f0a335302b21cd206da1c4feb/0_0_4032_2908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sports journalist and author Rupert Guinness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"721\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sports journalist and author Rupert Guinness, also an ultra endurance athlete, is riding from Darwin to Hobart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Sitting in a pub in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, Rupert Guinness is searching his mind for a Mike Tyson quote. “I think it’s ‘everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth’,” he says. “But in my case it should be: ‘I have a plan, until it’s 3am and I have been riding for 20 hours.’” Guinness, one of Australia’s most accomplished sports writers, chuckles and raises his beer.

I never liked maths and I don’t think I’ll like this maths. 20km/h does not sound very fast, but when you have the accumulated mental and physical fatigue, the weather, the things that go right and wrong, it can be a lot harder than you expect.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/14/the-long-and-winding-road-of-australian-cycling-race-melbourne-to-warrnambool-classic-older-than-tour-de-france\">The long and winding road of an Australian cycling race older than Tour de France | Kieran Pender</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Guinness’s maths is right, he will spend 240 of the next 288 hours on his bike pedalling south.

He has covered 31 editions of the Tour de France, four Olympics and two Rugby World Cups. In that time he has written 15 books and thousands of articles, with stints at the Sydney Morning Herald, the Daily Telegraph and The Australian. Alongside his professional life covering sport across the globe, Guinness has his own passion for endurance pursuits.</p> <p>“I rowed, I did triathlon,” Guinness says. The writer has completed 10 ironman races, including twice competing at the world championships in Hawaii. He also participated in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race on two occasions, winning line honours in 1984. Yet despite these experiences, and Guinness’s professional coverage of cycling, he never turned his mind to endurance riding.</p> <p>“I used to think, of this kind of stuff, that you’d have be bonkers to do it,” he says. “I remember when I first went to Europe [to cover cycling], in 1987, one of the Tour de France riders did the Race Across America [a historic 4,800km ultra-endurance race]. We had him on the cover of a magazine I was editing and I just thought: ‘That guy is mad – no way in hell would I ever do something that crazy.’ Ever!”</p> <p>Yet here he is. The change of heart is partly explained by coincidence. In 2016, Guinness had just finished a book on the history of Australian cycling, which included a chapter on the “overlanders” – cyclists who had ridden from coast to coast, when he saw an advertisement for the 2017 Indian Pacific Wheel Race, or Indy-Pac. “I remember I saw the advertisement and it said: ‘Is the Overlander in you’?” he told a podcast at the time. “Straight away the subject resonated with me. One thing led to another!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ac710c815472fcefde51c9c8b7349f20e90277e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac710c815472fcefde51c9c8b7349f20e90277e3/0_0_2400_3600/667.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Guinness\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Guinness, the 59-year-old sports journalist and author.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Roderick/Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Indy-Pac covers 5,471km from Fremantle to Sydney. Guinness’s first attempt was cut short with the tragic death of fellow competitor Mike Hall, who died after being hit by a car near Canberra (the race was subsequently cancelled). Writing a book about his experience, titled Overlander, led Guinness to reflect on how endurance feats had been assisting his mental health.</p> <p>“Writing the book really helped me,” he says. “I wrote a chapter about why I like this stuff, why I do this, and my editor said there was almost a book in that chapter alone. I realised it worked for me. Although I’m not saying people have to ride across the country to deal with their challenges!”</p> <p>Guinness has long battled bulimia, self-doubt and other mental health struggles. “Some of these I have had since I was a kid, and still deal with today,” he says. “Sometimes it just lurks up like a thief in the night. There’s no rationale for it – suddenly you have your head in a toilet bowl regurgitating your meal. Then the self-esteem gets worse because you feel you have surrendered to it.”</p> <p>Realising that these endurance events helped him, and gave him a platform to talk openly about mental health and wellbeing, Guinness has kept going. “Talking about it helps me deal with it and hopefully helps other people,” he says. Guinness entered and finished the 2018 Indy-Pac and has since contested a number of 24-hour races. In 2020, Guinness was due to contest the Race Across America; when Covid intervened, he did it on a stationary bike in Sydney – covering 3,358 virtual kilometres in 12 days.</p> <p>Guinness had planned to enter the 2021 Race Across America, but with the borders still closed, he decided to ride from Darwin to Hobart in preparation for an attempt in 2022. The slogan for his latest adventure is “power of the pedal – connecting people, connecting minds”, and Guinness is aligned with mental health groups Crossing the Line and Tour x Oz, an annual charity ride that raises funds for the Black Dog Institute.</p> <p>“So really there are twofold reasons for doing this,” he says. “The first is, I would have been doing Race Across America if it wasn’t for the Covid restrictions, so this is good preparation for next year. And secondly, why I do all of this endurance cycling in the first place, is to have a platform to raise awareness about mental health and wellbeing.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cd2ce7efb6105be28ccf90eeb2eeb51593726c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd2ce7efb6105be28ccf90eeb2eeb51593726c7/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guinness on his bike during the 2020 virtual Race Across America\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guinness on his bike during the 2020 virtual Race Across America.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Roderick/Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As one of Australia’s most respected cycling journalists, there is a certain irony in the fact that Guinness is now the one in the saddle.

At least I’m alone in the wilderness. It has made me think about how mentally suffocating it must be when a rider is having an off-day – in the middle of summer, with thousands of people roadside. You certainly look at 3,000km [the typical length of the Tour] a bit differently.”</p> <p>While Guinness will be in the relative wilderness for much of his ride, he won’t quite be alone. Instead, Guinness will be followed in two vehicles by an eight-person support crew, featuring a crew chief, mechanic, masseur, chef and kit-manager (his wife, Libby), primary driver, social media manager, stakeholder manager and photographer. “I have all the bases covered,” says Guinness.

At that point, he says, it will probably be: “Fuck the journey.” Follow Rupert Guinness’s journey via his dot-tracker.","charCount":"10135","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/kieran-pender\">Kieran Pender</a>"},{"headline":"Australia’s winter to be warmer than average, weather bureau forecasts","standfirst":"<p>BoM predicts higher than average minimums across the country and more rainfall than usual across northern and eastern Australia</p>","trailText":"BoM predicts higher than average minimums across the country and more rainfall than usual across northern and eastern Australia","byline":"Donna Lu","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c60aa428d2098fa11e21fa4292ebb74b14649af7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c60aa428d2098fa11e21fa4292ebb74b14649af7/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sydney runner looking to beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia’s winter is expected to be warmer than average and wetter in the north and east.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brook Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Australia is facing a warmer than average winter across most of the country, according to the Bureau of Meteorology’s <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/outlooks/#/overview/summary/\">annual winter outlook</a>.</p> <p>It predicts higher than average minimum temperatures across Australia, with maximum temperatures in northern, south-eastern and south-western Australia also likely to be higher than average.</p> <p>The bureau has forecast more winter rainfall than usual across northern and eastern Australia.</p> <p>Dr Naomi Benger, a climatologist at the bureau, said above-average sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean are driving extra moisture over much of the country.</p> <p>“Certainly, there are many farmers who would really appreciate that rainfall,” Benger said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/24/fire-money-how-indigenous-land-management-is-transforming-arnhem-land\">Fire money: how Indigenous land management is transforming Arnhem Land </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“In northern parts of the country, at this time of year, they have their dry season, which means it only takes very little rainfall to actually exceed their median.”</p> <p>Despite the expected winter rainfall, according to the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre’s <a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/hazardnotes/97\">winter outlook</a>, significant vegetation growth in the Northern Territory – the result of a bumper wet season – may lead to above-normal fire risk in parts of the Top End.</p> <p>Some parts of southern Australia will be drier than usual, including in southern Western Australia and western Tasmania, where neutral to dry conditions are expected.</p> <p>This is consistent with data from the past two decades showing a trend towards drier conditions in autumn and early winter. “For southern Australia, we’ve seen a decrease around 10 to 20% in wet season rainfall – that’s April to October,” said Benger.</p> <p>“Of course, some parts have seen very wet conditions [this autumn],” she said.

It predicts higher than average minimum temperatures across Australia, with maximum temperatures in northern, south-eastern and south-western Australia also likely to be higher than average. The bureau has forecast more winter rainfall than usual across northern and eastern Australia. Dr Naomi Benger, a climatologist at the bureau, said above-average sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean are driving extra moisture over much of the country. “Certainly, there are many farmers who would really appreciate that rainfall,” Benger said. “In northern parts of the country, at this time of year, they have their dry season, which means it only takes very little rainfall to actually exceed their median.” Despite the expected winter rainfall, according to the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre’s winter outlook, significant vegetation growth in the Northern Territory – the result of a bumper wet season – may lead to above-normal fire risk in parts of the Top End. Some parts of southern Australia will be drier than usual, including in southern Western Australia and western Tasmania, where neutral to dry conditions are expected. This is consistent with data from the past two decades showing a trend towards drier conditions in autumn and early winter. “For southern Australia, we’ve seen a decrease around 10 to 20% in wet season rainfall – that’s April to October,” said Benger. “Of course, some parts have seen very wet conditions [this autumn],” she said. New South Wales had its second-wettest March on record, with extreme rainfall and severe flooding. Parts of western Victoria and the agricultural region of South Australia saw below-average rainfall for autumn, and may be headed for a dry winter. Temperatures this past autumn have been the coolest across Australia since 2015. But in winter, coastal areas in particular may experience days which are warmer than average, and higher-than-average night-time temperatures are also expected across most of the country. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation – a long-term driver of climate – is neutral, and will likely remain that way throughout winter. “There are large areas of Australia whose rainfall is influenced by the behaviour of the Indian Ocean,” said Benger. “The Indian Ocean is undergoing a lot of change at the moment,” she said, which may affect the accuracy of predicted rainfall in some regions. The bureau based rainfall and temperature averages on observations made between 1990 and 2012.","charCount":"2632","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/donna-lu\">Donna Lu</a>"}]

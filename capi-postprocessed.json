newspaper, while farther north in <strong>Luebeck</strong>, prosecutors have opened a fraud probe, the WirtschaftsWoche weekly said. </p> <p>In <strong>Cologne</strong>, authorities carried out a surprise control of a testing centre, and the city of <strong>Munster</strong> has revoked the license of a company that operates around 50 testing centres. </p> <p>In an effort to boost Covid-19 testing, the German government made testing free several weeks ago, reimbursing companies up to €18 ($22) for each test conducted.</p> <p>But according to a joint investigation by several media companies, the testing centres do not have to furnish any documents to prove how many people they’ve tested when filing for government compensation and several have been inflating the figures. </p> <p>“They just have to send the number of tests [carried out], without any proof, and they are wired the money soon after,” according to a joint investigation by NDR and WDR public television and Suddeutsche Zeitung. </p> <p>As part of the effort, journalists counted the number of people who had come into the testing centres and then compared these numbers to what the establishments submitted to the government to get reimbursed. </p> <p>According to the investigation, one centre declared 422 tests, when only around 100 people had come in. Another filed for reimbursement of 1,743 tests done in a single day, when only 550 people had come in. </p> <p>The number of places offering free Covid-19 tests have mushroomed since the government introduced the free scheme - in the <strong>North Rhine-Westphalia</strong> region there are currently nearly 8,000 and the capital <strong>Berlin</strong> has at least 1,200. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T14:44:15.248Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-60b24aac8f086d71cc15e759\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T14:09:42.105Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Spain</strong> will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday, hoping to salvage the country’s battered tourism sector in time for the summer season. <br></p> <p>Reuters reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Spain’s maritime authorities approved the reopening because of falling Covid-19 incidence rates and an increase in vaccinations, according to an order in Spain’s state gazette published on Saturday. <br></p> <p>Spain banned cruise ships from docking in its ports in June 2020 as the pandemic ripped through Europe.

30s in <strong>England</strong> have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. <br></p> <p>NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. <br></p> <p>Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses.</p> <p>People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. <br></p> <p>The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. <br></p> <p>It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. <br></p> <p>NHS England said so far 600,000

vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection.</p> </blockquote> <p> Health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. <br></p> <p>He said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we enjoy the

and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was “clearly more transmissible”. <br></p> <p>He said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to be reassured that we’re in a very different position now in that we’ve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. <br></p> <p>We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we’re very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that’s the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. <br></p> </blockquote> <p>The unlocking of society in <strong>England</strong> will be a “gradual process” that requires a “cautious” approach even if the government’s target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to “look very carefully” at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. <br></p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown.</p> </blockquote> <p>He suggested it was “better” to be on “the cautious side”, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you’ve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. <br></p> <p>So I think we’ve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it’s not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

Both numbers have been on a downward trend in recent weeks. The health ministry also reported 68 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals, bringing the total to 82,946. Thousands of people, masked and tested for the coronavirus, packed inside a Paris arena for a concert Saturday as part of a public health experiment to prepare France to host large scale events. Associated Press reports: The show at AccorHotels Arena in eastern Paris features 1980s French rock band Indochine and DJ Etienne de Crecy. But the attention was mostly on the concert-goers. The Paris public hospital authority helped organize the event to determine whether it’s safe to allow 5,000 masked people to dance together in the open pit of an indoor concert arena without social distancing. The attendees are seeing the show for free but were required to take three virus tests, two before and one after the concert. To further reduce risk, organisers only allowed people 18-45 years old without underlying health conditions to participate, according to the hospital authority. France has not allowed such music concerts since early 2020. Cultural venues were shut for most of the past 14 months as authorities tried to contain persistent surges of virus infections that filled hospitals and were linked to more than 109,000 deaths. My colleague Damien Gayle is covering the protest through London in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown march is the latest in a series of large protests against the UK government’s coronavirus measures. Large crowds of football fans took over Porto’s riverside area on Saturday ahead of the Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City. Some 16,500 fans will be allowed into the stadium when the match kicks off at 8 p.m. but many others travelled to support their teams from the sidelines. Dozens of packed planes touched down at the city’s airport on Saturday morning. The fans from England were largely maskless and did not socially distance, to the annoyance of some locals, Reuters reports. In Portugal, masks are still mandatory outside if people cannot observe social distancing. Ines Andrade, a 19-year-old student from Porto, was visibly upset as she watched the scenes from nearby, saying it was “revolting” to see how fans were behaving, just four months after Portugal faced its toughest battle against Covid-19. “For us, Portuguese, is it very disturbing to see these people come here and ruin everything we have tried to achieve over the last months and year.” Fans had to present a negative Covid-19 test on arrival at the airport. But there has been concern in Portugal that the event could fuel a spike in cases after authorities decided to relax coronavirus rules for the match. Portugal is on the British government’s “green” list allowing tourists to visit the country without quarantining on their return. An update from the UK’s health secretary. Germany will introduce stricter controls on the administering of coronavirus tests, health minister Jens Spahn said on Saturday, after local media reports accused some centres of accounting fraud. “There will be more random checks,” Spahn said on Twitter. “Pragmatism is necessary these days. Those who exploit that must not be allowed to get away with it.” Germany offers its citizens at least one free coronavirus test per week, with several federal states providing one free test a day. The state pays €18 (£15.46) per test. Many private test centres have been set up in recent weeks, Reuters reports. Some coronavirus test centres have been charging for more tests than they have carried out, daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and broadcaster ARD reported this week. Prosecutors in the city of Bochum opened an investigation into one centre following the reports. Carmakers in the Indian automobile hub of Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, will be allowed to keep operating, the state government said, amid protests by workers who fear catching Covid-19 in one of the country’s hardest-hit states. Tamil Nadu authorities extended a near-total lockdown on Friday as coronavirus infections and deaths rise in the southern state, where average cases run at more than 30,000 a day, official figures show, Reuters reports. But a government order issued on Saturday said so-called continuous process industries, which include auto factories, would be allowed to function in accordance with measures such as social distancing to stem the virus’s spread. It also urged vehicle manufacturers to initiate immediate action to vaccinate all their employees within a month. Italy reported 83 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday compared with 126 the day before, the health ministry said. The daily tally of new infections fell to 3,351 from 3,738, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 126,002 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the seventh-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.213 million cases to date. The number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 – not including those in intensive care – stood at 6,800 on Saturday, down from 7,192 a day earlier. The UK government said a further seven people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Saturday, bringing the UK total to 127,775. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The government also said that, as of 9am on Saturday, there had been a further 3,398 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. It brings the total to 4,480,945. Vietnam’s health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country had detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK variants and spreads quickly by air, the online newspaper VnExpress reported. The World Health Organization has not yet responded to the finding. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a little over two weeks. Infections in Germany continue to fall, with the country’s seven-day incidence now at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus – with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver – as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighbourhood and ordered its residents to stay at home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following a fast rise in infections. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has been low. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday. That’s it from me, my colleague Nadeem Badshah will be taking over shortly. Prosecutors in several German regions have launched investigations of companies offering free Covid-19 tests after news reports said that some were padding their numbers to claim more money from the government. Prosecutors raided a company in the northwestern city of Bochum on Friday, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, while farther north in Luebeck, prosecutors have opened a fraud probe, the WirtschaftsWoche weekly said. In Cologne, authorities carried out a surprise control of a testing centre, and the city of Munster has revoked the license of a company that operates around 50 testing centres. In an effort to boost Covid-19 testing, the German government made testing free several weeks ago, reimbursing companies up to €18 ($22) for each test conducted. But according to a joint investigation by several media companies, the testing centres do not have to furnish any documents to prove how many people they’ve tested when filing for government compensation and several have been inflating the figures. “They just have to send the number of tests [carried out], without any proof, and they are wired the money soon after,” according to a joint investigation by NDR and WDR public television and Suddeutsche Zeitung. As part of the effort, journalists counted the number of people who had come into the testing centres and then compared these numbers to what the establishments submitted to the government to get reimbursed. According to the investigation, one centre declared 422 tests, when only around 100 people had come in. Another filed for reimbursement of 1,743 tests done in a single day, when only 550 people had come in. The number of places offering free Covid-19 tests have mushroomed since the government introduced the free scheme - in the North Rhine-Westphalia region there are currently nearly 8,000 and the capital Berlin has at least 1,200. Spain will allow cruise ships to dock in its ports from 7 June, the transport ministry said on Saturday, hoping to salvage the country’s battered tourism sector in time for the summer season. Reuters reports: Spain’s maritime authorities approved the reopening because of falling Covid-19 incidence rates and an increase in vaccinations, according to an order in Spain’s state gazette published on Saturday. Spain banned cruise ships from docking in its ports in June 2020 as the pandemic ripped through Europe. A number of high-profile spreader events were linked to cruise liners around the world. “Shipping companies will have to comply with measures established by the health ministry [...] to guarantee total security, both for cruise passengers and for the cities where they land,” the transport ministry tweeted on Saturday. It added that before the pandemic, Spain was the second most popular destination for international cruises in Europe. Spain, which was also the second most visited country in the world before the health crisis, was one of Europe’s worst-hit nations, recording over 79,000 coronavirus deaths and 3.7 million cases. Foreign tourism plunged 80% last year as a raft of restrictions brought the industry to a standstill. But with infection rates falling, vaccinations progressing, and most regions able to scrap curfews, Spain is looking towards reopening its vital tourism industry this summer. Last week Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced Spain would allow people from anywhere in the world to enter the country from 7 Jun, provided they were vaccinated. Tens of thousands of protesters have begun marching through central London in opposition to vaccine passports and coronavirus lockdowns. The anti-lockdown march, the latest in a series of large protests against the government’s coronavirus measures, began at 1pm in Parliament Square and made its way north to Oxford Street. Protesters chanted “freedom” and sang along to Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds as the they waved placards proclaiming slogans such as “we know where the rabbit hole ends”. The route of the march was not disclosed before it began. Activists at the front were directing the crowd via a series of coloured smoke signals. Louise Creffield, the founder of Save Our Rights UK, one of the groups behind the protest, told the Guardian the focus was on medical freedom. She said: We’re very concerned about the track and trace being turned into vaccine passports and the increase in mandated testing. We’re campaigning for a medical freedom bill which would prevent any coercion and any discrimination for not partaking in a medical procedure, because where there’s that there can’t be fair and informed consent. Once we lose our medical freedom there is no saying if and when we will get it back and where this slippery slope could take us. We’ve seen a huge amount of mission creep this year, so there’s no telling where it could go. In a Telegram post published the day before the protest, Save Our Rights UK said they planned to take the march on a different route to those in previous weeks. The post said: “This won’t be a scenic walk, we will be taking our message to community areas that we haven’t hit before and WE WILL BE STAYING AT THE END LOCATION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.” Lebanon’s health authorities have launched a Covid-19 vaccination “marathon” to speed up inoculations around the country, including areas where turnout has so far been low. The Associated Press reports: The daylong campaign offered AstraZeneca vaccines at 30 different centers around the country without prior appointment to encourage people over age 30 to show up. The capital Beirut was not included in the campaign. A vaccination program that started in February targeted older age groups, primarily through registration on a government-operated platform and appointments. As of Saturday afternoon, 7,700 people had been vaccinated in the push. Pictures of lines outside centers north of Beirut showed turnout was high, particularly among foreign workers, many of whom had been reluctant or unable to register on the government-operated digital platform. There were also lines in towns and villages in the east and mountains, where turnout has so far been fickle. Lebanon has managed to curb the number of new virus cases since the start of the year. The small country, reeling from a crippling economic crisis that predated the pandemic, is eager to restore economic activities. Officials want to open up businesses and tourist attractions ahead of the summer season to draw in much needed foreign currency. So far, over 700,000 people have been vaccinated in the country of 6 million. More than 530,000 have been infected with over 7,700 deaths since February 2020. Restrictions in place since the start of 2021 have eased over the last few weeks, allowing restaurants, bars and malls to reopen and receive customers until late. “We are living many crises and our way to revive our economic life and restore some Lebanese social and culture norms forces us to think of greater ways for immunization in shorter periods,” Lebanon’s health minister Hamad Hassan told a local TV station. Launching a Covid immunisation programme for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. They say UK medical authorities, who are currently studying how vaccines for adolescents might be administered, should move with great care over the implementation of such a programme. They acknowledge it could help reduce outbreaks and the spread of Covid but also warn it could also raise important practical and ethical problems. Doctors would be giving vaccines for which there was limited information about possible side-effects to children who have nothing to gain from such a move, said Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Children transmit Covid to some extent, although they rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves. If you offer them vaccines, then you put them at risk of possible side-effects – so there really needs to be some significant, tangible benefit to them, not just the indirect protection of adults from Covid-19.” The preparation of plans to give Covid vaccines to UK children comes in the wake of the US decision to launch such a programme and at a time when Germany has indicated it is planning a similar move. Canada and Switzerland have also approved plans, while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last week agreed to extend approval for the use of the Pfizer vaccine on 12- to 15-year-olds. But the move to vaccinate children has been criticised by global health leaders, including the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who earlier this month said that although he understood why some countries wanted to vaccinate children and adolescents, he urged them to reconsider. My colleague Robin McKie reports. More than half of people in their 30s in England have received a coronavirus vaccine dose in a period of little over two weeks, new figures reveal. NHS England said that, since it began opening up the vaccine rollout to this age group on 13 May, about 53% of those aged 30 to 39 have been given at least one dose. Overall, more than 32 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, almost three-quarters of the total adult population, while more than 20 million people have had both doses. People aged 30 to 31 were from Wednesday invited to get their jab, with more than 5m appointments made through the national booking service within 72 hours. The data comes as the NHS is asking people aged 50 and over, as well as those who are clinically vulnerable, to bring forward their second Covid-19 vaccination to help combat the spread of the B1.617.2 variant first identified in India. It follows the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending earlier this month that the second dose interval be shortened from 12 weeks to eight for people in priority cohorts. NHS England said so far 600,000 people have been invited to rearrange their second jab through the national booking service, with around a quarter moving their appointment earlier. NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: It is remarkable that, in little over two weeks since people in their 30s began getting their invites, more than half have now had their first dose. This success is no happy accident but the result of months of careful planning and the sheer hard work and dedication of NHS staff. The Covid-19 vaccine is our most effective weapon against coronavirus and the best way of protecting yourself and loved ones, so, if you do one thing this bank holiday weekend, book your lifesaving jab and, crucially, if you’re contacted by the NHS to do so, bring forward your second dose of vital protection. Health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was “absolutely thrilled” at the progress in the 30s age group and thanked those coming forward “to do their bit to defeat the virus”. He said: As we enjoy the reopening of pubs and restaurants again, vaccines will play a crucial role in protecting us and those around us. Vaccines are the best way out of this pandemic and I urge everybody to take up the offer when eligible. The Duchess of Cambridge has been given her first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. A message from the 39-year-old on the Kensington Palace Twitter account said: “Yesterday I received my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at London’s Science Museum. “I’m hugely grateful to everyone who is playing a part in the rollout – thank you for everything you are doing.” I’m Jedidajah Otte and will be taking back over now for the next few hours.

Launching a programme of Covid-19 immunisations for children should be considered only in special circumstances, leading health experts have warned. Offering vaccines to children – who “rarely suffer badly from the disease themselves” – could raise important practical and ethical problems, they said. Meanwhile, the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also urged countries to reconsider vaccinating children when lower-income countries do not have enough doses to immunise vulnerable populations. In contrast, Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, said this morning that “it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers”. He added that although it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”, he believes there’s “a good argument” for vaccinating over-12s, given the “phenomenal safety records” of some available vaccines. The organiser of the Edinburgh Fringe has said the world’s largest arts festival is “in danger” if the Scottish government does not ease social distancing rules for venues within a fortnight. Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, called on ministers to replace the current two-metre rule with the one-metre rule used in hospitality in order to help secure the future of the 75-year-old festival. McCarthy told the Times Scotland: “Within another two weeks, it’s going to be impossible for any [Edinburgh promoter] to put on anything. “There’s a real danger for the future of the Fringe. One year of no festival was manageable, and we were able to keep it in hearts and minds and everybody still held that space in their calendar, as that annual moment for reconnection and getting together. At two years, you jeopardise the solid space the Fringe has held for 75 years.” She urged the government to “have that leap of faith” and trust venues to deliver services safely in the same way as the hospitality sector. The UK government appears to have abandoned its “data not dates” principle, an expert advising its coronavirus response has warned, adding that its reluctance to delay unlocking was leading to “contradictory” messaging. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B), joined scientists warning against the final lifting of restrictions on 21 June as cases passed 4,000 for the first time since late March on Friday. Reicher said the government had invested “so much political capital” in particular dates that it has become difficult to diverge from them if the data suggests it is necessary. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we are in a pickle of the government’s own making at the moment. I think the reason for that is it has departed from its own mantra of ‘data not dates’. Very quickly ‘data not dates’ became ‘dates not data’.” Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break.

Indonesia will introduce a “Work From Bali” programme for civil servants aimed at helping to revive the island’s battered economy. Bloomberg reports: The coordinating ministry for maritime and investment affairs will start with a pilot project in Nusa Dua, once a prime location for major conferences including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2013, to encourage more meetings and outbound activities on the island. “We hope that with the arrival of government and state-owned company employees, the gears of Bali’s economy will start moving,” Hermin Esti Setyowati, an assistant deputy at the ministry, said in a statement on Saturday. Tourism-reliant Bali has been among the country’s hardest-hit provinces as borders remain shut, leaving its hotels and beaches empty. Its GDP shrank 9.9% in the first quarter from a year ago, following a 9.3% contraction for all of 2020. The island welcomed just 25 foreigners from January to March, compared with 1.1 million in the same period last year. The local government plans to accelerate its vaccination program with a goal of reaching herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, which could allow the island to reopen to international tourists. There is a “good argument” for vaccinating older children against Covid-19 given the safety records of some Covid vaccines, an expert has said. Klaus Okkenhaug, professor of immunology in the department of pathology at the University of Cambridge, told Times Radio that the decision on whether to give children coronavirus jabs was a “difficult question” that requires balancing wider benefits against the direct ones for children. He said: I think for a whole population it would of course help for children to be vaccinated because it also reduces their opportunities to transmit this virus to their teachers. Prof Okkenhaug said that when considering the “direct benefits to the children” it was “a little bit of a fine balance because they are so unlikely to be affected by the virus”. He added: But I think given the phenomenal safety records of some of the vaccines out there, there’s a good argument for going ahead at least with older children, say 12 and above. A coronavirus surge sweeping through Thailand’s prisons has thrown the spotlight on the kingdom’s overcrowded penal system, where some inmates have less space to sleep than the inside of a coffin. AFP reports: More than 22,000 people have tested positive inside jails, where inmates living cheek by jowl have been encouraged to keep wearing their masks even while they sleep. Authorities have floated plans to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions and have announced funding for more testing and medical care in recent days. But those behind bars say they have been kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak. “Prisoners don’t have the knowledge to protect themselves,” said Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, a high-profile activist facing charges under Thailand’s harsh royal defamation law. Somyot was bailed last month and told AFP that he had not been tested for Covid-19 once during his 10-week stint in custody. He was not worried about contracting the disease while in jail because he had no idea about the level of risk. “But after this I’m so scared [for everyone still inside] ... if you are inside the prison you are at risk, it’s unavoidable,” he said. Thailand’s prison outbreak has skyrocketed from just 10 publicly announced cases a month ago and sparked growing public concern after a handful of prominent activists contracted the illness. Among them was student leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul, who helped lead a series of rallies last year demanding political reforms in the kingdom, and who tested positive after she was released on bail. The Thai prison population stood at around 311,000 earlier this year, the International Federation for Human Rights said – more than two and a half times the system’s official capacity. Four inmates in every five are serving time for drug charges because of harsh anti-narcotics laws that can see offenders jailed for a decade for possessing just a few methamphetamine pills. Many cells are so packed with bodies that some inmates only have half a metre (less than 2ft) of space. “That is less room for a body than the inside of a coffin,” justice minister Somsak Thepsutin told local media in February. Officials have tested more than 36,000 inmates in recent weeks and begun delivering Covid vaccines to inmates and prison staff. Somsak said he was examining ways to give early releases to prisoners with underlying medical conditions, possibly through a royal pardon. Even if the plan goes ahead, prisoners will still have to complete a quarantine before returning home. India has recorded the lowest number of new daily infections in 45 days, the Times of India reports, although a further 173,790 fresh cases were logged in the country on Saturday. The official death toll climbed to 322,512 as a further 3,617 Covid fatalities recorded on Saturday, according to health ministry data. Daily recoveries continue to outnumber the daily new cases for the 16th consecutive day. A total of 2,080,048 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. The governing civic body of Mumbai on Friday allowed walk-in vaccination for students who have been accepted for university courses abroad and require immunisation to travel. France’s budget deficit for 2021 will stand at €220bn, some €47bn higher than previously estimated, Olivier Dussopt, the public accounts minister, told AFP on Saturday. The increase is “a result of supporting measures that we’re continuing to take to support the recovery” from the devastating effects that Covid-19 shutdowns wreaked on the eurozone’s second-largest economy, he said. It is not yet clear how the revised numbers will affect the budget deficit when expressed as percentage of GDP, which was previously forecast to hit 9% this year, a postwar record. Public debt was previously forecast to reach 118% of GDP. The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cost the French state nearly half a trillion euros over three years - €158bn in 2020, an expected €171bn in 2021 and a forecast €96bn in 2022, Dussopt said in April. France has borrowed heavily to try to keep the economy afloat through three nationwide lockdowns, including money spent on supporting salaries of people furloughed and aid for companies struggling to stay afloat during the crisis. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou shut down a neighborhood and ordered its residents to stay home on Saturday for door-to-door coronavirus testing following an upsurge in infections. Guangzhou, a business and industrial centre of 15 million people north of Hong Hong, has reported 20 new infections over the past week. The number is small compared with India’s thousands of daily cases but has alarmed Chinese authorities who believed they had the virus under control. The spread of infections was “fast and strong,” the Global Times newspaper cited health authorities as saying. Saturday’s order to stay home applied to residents of five streets in Liwan district in the city centre. Outdoor markets, childcare centres and entertainment venues were closed. Indoor restaurant dining was prohibited, while grade schools were told to stop in-person tuition. People in parts of four nearby districts were ordered to limit outdoor activity. The city government earlier ordered testing of hundreds of thousands of residents following the initial infections. The government said some 700,000 people had been tested by Wednesday. China reports a handful of new cases every day but says almost all are believed to be people who were infected abroad, the Associated Press reports. The mainland’s official death toll stands at 4,636 out of 91,061 confirmed cases. On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Guangzhou and 14 in other parts of the country that it said came from abroad. Most of the latest infections in Guangzhou are believed to be linked to a 75-year-old woman who was found on 21 May to have the variant first identified in India, state media say. Most of the others attended a dinner with her or live together. That infection spread to the nearby city of Nanshan, where one new confirmed case and two asymptomatic cases were reported Saturday after people from Guangzhou were tested, according to the Global Times. Infections in Germany continue on a downward trend, according to the country’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI), with health authorities having reported 5,426 new cases within one day to the institute, down from 6,419 a week earlier. The seven-day incidence on Saturday morning stood at 37.5 nationwide, down from 39.8 on Friday and 66.8 in the previous week. Public holidays have, however, resulted in fewer people seeing a doctor, which means fewer samples are taken and fewer laboratory tests. Therefore, fewer new infections are reported. According to the RKI, 163 new deaths were recorded across Germany within 24 hours. A week ago 170 deaths from the virus were logged. The RKI has counted 3,675,296 Covid-19 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, but the actual total number is likely significantly higher, since many infections are not detected. The Philippines said on Saturday people were allowed to again go to work in Saudi Arabia, reversing a brief deployment ban after the kingdom said they would not be charged for Covid-19 tests and quarantine upon arrival. Reuters reports: “Our Saudi-bound workers will no longer be disadvantaged,” said labour secretary, Silvestre Bello. Flag carrier Philippine Airlines said it would accept Filipino workers on flights to Dammam and Riyadh, waiving rebooking fees for passengers who had been unable to board because of the deployment ban. Bello apologised for the “inconvenience and momentary anguish” caused by his Thursday ban, saying: “I understand that the suspension order drew confusion and irritation among our affected departing overseas Filipino workers.” More than a million Filipinos work in Saudi Arabia, the most preferred destination of overseas Filipino workers in 2019, government data shows. Many Filipinos are hired as construction workers, domestic helpers or nurses. In 2020, Filipinos in Saudi Arabia sent home $1.8bn in remittances, a key support for the consumption-led economy. With more than 1.2 million cases and 20,722 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest Covid-19 infections and casualties in south-east Asia, behind Indonesia. People should be “very concerned” about the spread of the Indian variant of coronavirus, but “reassured” by the scale of the vaccine rollout, an expert has said. Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast that the variant was “clearly more transmissible”. He said: We need to be reassured that we’re in a very different position now in that we’ve got a highly vaccinated population and we just need to continue moving at speed. We do know that with this particular variant you do need two doses to offer complete protection, and so we’re very, very keen to make sure that all those, particularly higher risk groups, that’s the over-50s and those with underlying illness, receive their second vaccination as soon as feasible. The unlocking of society in England will be a “gradual process” that requires a “cautious” approach even if the government’s target date for removing all legal limits on social contact in the country on 21 June remains in place, he added, emphasising the need to “look very carefully” at what happens with the India variant in the next one or two weeks. He said: I think we need to look at that data very carefully before we completely un-lockdown. He suggested it was “better” to be on “the cautious side”, adding: Even if we do un-lockdown, if you are in a vulnerable position, particularly if you’ve not been vaccinated, you do need to carry on being cautious, even if the 21 June date goes ahead. So I think we’ve all got used to living within boundaries at the moment and I think it’s not an all or none, I think it will be a gradual process even if the 21 June date goes ahead. Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf said there was “significant community transmission” of coronavirus in hotspots in the city of Glasgow. The city will remain under level 3 of Scotland’s restrictions until at least 5 June and Yousaf said urgent work was being carried out to understand the outbreak in south Glasgow and how the India variant arrived. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: In a few concentrated hotspots ... we are seeing significant community transmission. The levels and the numbers of cases are continuing to rise. In other parts of the country “local health teams tell us they are relatively contained outbreaks” linked to either schools or domestic clusters, but that was not the case in Glasgow. What we are seeing is it’s coming in in areas where there is a large, diverse community so therefore there is a probability the variant has come in from international travel. Therefore we are trying to get to the bottom of how it managed to get in. Victoria state in Australia has recorded five new locally acquired cases of coronavirus, with four linked to a food distribution delivery driver, as the state enters its second day of its fourth lockdown. The update brings the total number of cases from the latest outbreak in Melbourne to 35. A record 56,624 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, surpassing the previous day’s record of 47,462 tests. On Saturday, the state’s Covid testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, said four of the new cases were linked to a person who tested positive on Friday. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the person was a food distribution delivery driver who visited “multiple stores and grocery sites across metropolitan Melbourne on 18 and 19 May”. There are now more than 150 exposure sites and more than 15,000 primary and secondary contacts who must self-isolate after coming into potential contact with a person with Covid-19. Foley said the individual “worked during their infectious period” but they “showed no signs of Covid symptoms themselves”. He also thanked the food distribution company and customers for working with contact tracers. Weimar said four of the new cases announced on Saturday were household contacts of the delivery driver, including a student at Mount Ridley college in Craigieburn. He said these four people had only been in isolation for one day. The fifth case was separate, and was an employee of firm Stratton Finance who became infected at a display home in Mickleham. Late on Friday the Victorian health department announced new tier 1 exposure sites – where people are most at risk of catching and spreading the virus. A full list of exposure sites can be found here. Foley announced what he called a “hat-trick of records”, as the state administered a record number of tests and vaccinations over the past three days. Taiwan reported 486 new domestic Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 166 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests. After successfully keeping coronavirus at bay, Taiwan is currently in the grip of its first serious outbreak. The island is desperately seeking vaccines to protect its people, and Taiwan’s neighbour China has offered to help, the BBC reported. Up until the mid-May, the country had logged only around 1,500 infections and 12 deaths, before cases began to rise sharply. On Tuesday, health minister Chen Shih-chung announced 2m vaccine doses would arrive in Taiwan in June, and 10m by the end of August. Russia reported 9,289 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 3,241 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,053,748. The government coronavirus task force said 401 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 120,807. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021. Malaysia reported 9,020 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest daily toll since the start of the pandemic. This is the fifth straight day of record new infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 558,534. The country’s prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has announced a nationwide “total lockdown” from 1 to 14 June that will apply to all social and economic areas, with only essential services and economic sectors listed by the national security council remaining in operation, ABC reports. “With the latest rise in daily cases showing a drastically upward trend, hospital capacity across the country to treat Covid-19 patients are becoming limited,” Muhyiddin said in a statement. Prof Stephen Reicher, a psychologist on the UK’s Sage sub-committee advising the government on behavioural science, said “confusion” over the government’s approach was undermining efforts to control the pandemic. Ahead of the planned 21 June easing of restrictions in England, he said the government was in a “pickle” because it appeared to have abandoned the “data, not dates” principle. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today: The data we are seeing at the moment suggests we have a problem. We don’t know how big the problem is - it might be bad, it might be very bad, we will learn in the next week or two. But the problem for the government is: on the one hand it can’t delay what it has been promising for so long, but on the other hand it is aware of the dangers of so doing. And so you see that in the fact that they are beginning to act in a rather contradictory way. They’re saying to us, for instance on travel: ‘you can travel internationally but please don’t’. They say of social contact ‘you can hug, but please don’t hug’. They say of restrictions, ‘no restrictions but please don’t go in and out of the hotspots’. That contradiction, that sense of confusion, I think is undermining the response. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus live blog. Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said on Saturday the country has detected a new variant of the coronavirus, which is a mix of the India and UK Covid-19 variants and spreads quickly by air, online newspaper VnExpress reported. Vietnam’s latest coronavirus wave, which began about a month ago, has seen 3,595 local Covid-19 cases so far in 33 cities and provinces. He said the coronavirus responsible for the new wave is much more transmissible, especially in the air. Viral cultures in the laboratory revealed that the virus replicated itself very quickly, he added, explaining why there are so many new cases in different locations in a shorter time frame. So far, Vietnam has recorded the presence of seven coronavirus variants, including ones from the UK, India and South Africa.

Caution is needed in determining whether England’s coronavirus restrictions can be lifted next month or “things will get bad very, very quickly”, a professor whose argument against herd immunity helped trigger the first lockdown has warned. Sir Tim Gowers, a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, told the Guardian the downside of being “a bit more cautious” was a lot smaller than the downside of getting it wrong, as UK Covid cases rose by 4,184 on Friday – the highest increase since 1 April. Asked about the next step in lockdown easing in England, due on June 21, Prof Gowers said he did not believe the plans were necessarily at risk, but urged caution. He said: Because Boris Johnson has made a big thing about all the steps being irreversible, I think he’s put himself in a position where once he takes a step, he’ll be extremely reluctant to reverse because that would be a big U-turn, an embarrassing climbdown. So I think if that’s the way you’re going to play things, then you should be very, very cautious about every step you take ... And maybe everything [will] be OK, maybe the number of people who are vaccinated will be just enough ... ‘R’ will broadly speaking stay below one even with Indian variants. But if it’s not OK, we know, because of mathematics, that things will get bad very, very quickly. Or at least, maybe it won’t look that quick to start with, but it’ll grow exponentially. So it’ll pick up speed and become a big problem. Read my colleague Ben Quinn’s full story here. Prof Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage from University College London, said reopening should be delayed a few more months.","charCount":"43712","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/nadeembadshah\">Nadeem Badshah</a> (now), and <a href=\"profile/jedidajah-otte\">Jedidajah Otte</a> and <a href=\"profile/clea-skopeliti\">Clea Skopeliti</a> (earlier)"},{"headline":"Macron seeks African reset with new view of France’s troubled history on continent ","standfirst":"<p>Honest examination of French colonial record in Africa and responsibilty in Rwanda key to new strategy, though critics say little has changed</p>","trailText":"Honest examination of French colonial record in Africa and responsibilty in Rwanda key to new strategy, though critics say little has changed","byline":"Jason Burke in Pretoria","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4610a403e4991c5fabbe82a5d340904c6d56edc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4610a403e4991c5fabbe82a5d340904c6d56edc6/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"France’s President Emmanuel Macron reviews the honour guard during a welcoming ceremony at the government’s Union Buildings, in Pretoria, South Africa, on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">France’s President Emmanuel Macron reviews the honour guard during a welcoming ceremony at the government’s Union Buildings, in Pretoria, South Africa, on 28 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>With the golden winter sun slanting across the palm trees and yellow sandstone, the scene was perfect.

Emmanuel Macron and his host, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, walked down the red carpet of the Union buildings in Pretoria as the Marseillaise resonated through the clean, crisp air. The historic setting was apt. Since taking power in 2017, the French president has sought a broad reset of national strategy, relations and intervention in Africa. He has chosen a very contemporary way to do this: by re-examining the past. In Africa, he is not alone in regarding history as important. Last week Germany agreed to pay Namibia €1.1bn (£940m) as it officially recognised its colonists’ murder of tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people at the start of the 20th century – a gesture of reconciliation, but not legally binding reparations, for what Berlin now recognises was a “genocide”. Others also see the history of the continent as critical – and useful – today. China, which has made a major effort to extend influence across Africa, systematically highlights the bloody past of western colonial powers on the continent. Russia has consciously invoked the relationships and myths of the cold war, telling countries such as Angola that the former ties bind tight. Britain has tried to invoke imperial history through the Commonwealth, in the somewhat optimistic belief that leaders and citizens of former colonies will remember fondly decades of exploitative and sometimes brutal rule. So far this appears to have had little success. Early efforts to restore Zimbabwe to the Commonwealth have foundered and the government in the troubled former British colony recently unveiled a statue in the centre of the capital, Harare, of a revered spiritual leader who resisted subjugation by Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa company. “It’s true that France has a history in Africa that is complex,” said Hervé Berville, a French member of parliament who accompanied Macron. “Sometimes of happiness, of family, a wealth of cultural and other exchange, but more complex, deeper, heavier too. And we have to recognise our wrongdoings, our mistakes … This is not to self-flagellate but simply to be honest with ourselves and others who have lived the consequences of our actions.” On Thursday, the French president spent a day in Rwanda, a former Belgian colony whose government has long accused France of complicity in the killing of about 800,000 mostly Tutsi Rwandans in 1994. In Kigali, Macron asked for forgiveness and spoke of how the French bore a terrible responsibility after standing by a genocidal regime for far too long – though he said it had the best of intentions. The speech was based on the findings of a French report by historians and archivists given unprecedented access to key French government archives. Though not an apology, Macron’s words were enough to satisfy Paul Kagame, in power in Rwanda for 27 years and one of the most influential leaders on the continent. “By recognising the errors of our past [in Africa], we can better prepare our future there,” said Berville, an orphan evacuated by the French army from Rwanda who grew up in France. Another benefit is pre-empting the efforts of competitors such as Russia or China from “instrumentalising and exploiting” that history. A similar historical inquiry investigated atrocities committed by French authorities, police and troops in Algeria during the colonial period and bloody war of independence there. Then there are moves to repatriate at least some of the works in French museums that were looted from Africa. Mohamed Diatta, an analyst at the ISS in Pretoria, said Macron had been inconsistent but appeared to have recognised the importance of the past in opening up new opportunities to engage with Africa’s young population. “There is a little bit of movement and it is encouraging. France’s ultimate guiding principle is protection and advancement of its own interests, that’s not going to change, but the way they do things can change,” said Diatta. “France’s relationship with Africa … cannot be separated from how France is dealing with its colonial past in France itself; how France deals with its immigrant population of African descent in France. There is this past that needs to be addressed in a proper manner.” But some aspects of the past can also be usefully ignored. Macron’s new strategy sees the continent as an immensely varied whole, not divided by old empires or language, with opportunities for political or economic advantage well outside the traditional “FrançAfrique”. Analysts point out that South Africa, a former British imperial dominion where English is the primary language of business and administration, is not a traditional partner of Paris. “France recognises there is an advantage in non-French-speaking parts of Africa that don’t have the hang-ups and suspicions of FrançAfrique and so is making a bigger push there,” said Alex Vines, director of the Africa programme at Chatham House. “There are historical relationships with former colonies but it’s not there that its businesses are making money and making inroads.” Critics point out that there is much that looks still familiar about French interventions.

A fresh spate of violence swept the South American nation on Friday night, with protesters battling police who attempted to lift roadblocks across the country. Hardest hit was Cali, a major south-west city that has become the centre of the protests that began on 28 April over an unpopular and since-axed tax reform and have since morphed into a howl of rage at the country’s entrenched economic disparity, which has been aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic. As they have done for most nights over the last month, police in riot gear fought against protesters, while reports abounded of the officers continuing to use live rounds, and deliberately injuring protesters. “There’s been gunshots all night, we don’t know how many are injured,” said one resident in Siloé, a neighbourhood that has seen nightly skirmishes. “It looks like a war.” In the city’s wealthy southern reaches, gunmen in civilian clothing joined the fray, firing on protesters, as police looked on, doing little to stop the violence. Protesters also set a police kiosk on fire. At another neighbourhood, one off-duty agent with the attorney general’s office fired on a crowd, killing two demonstrators, before being killed himself. City officials and human rights watchdogs were united in their outrage over the developments. Nearly three weeks earlier, a similar wave of vigilante violence against protesters rocked the city, though no fatalities were confirmed. Last night four people died, including the agent. “It is inadmissible that we have civilians practically turning our city into a battlefield,” the city’s security secretary, Carlos Alberto Rojas, told Radio Caracol on Saturday morning. “What has happened must be investigated by all the authorities.” Elsewhere in the country, protests were largely peaceful though in some cases pockmarked with violence. In Popayán, a city 90 miles south of Cali, protesters attempted to burn a bank branch. In Madrid, a town outside the capital Bogotá, protesters battled with police for hours. The police response to the unrest has been brutal, with at least 43 protesters killed by officers since the unrest began, alongside reports of torture and sexual abuse, according to Temblores, a local human rights watchdog. Members of the press have also been targeted, with Colombia’s Foundation for the Freedom of the Press reporting 144 cases of harassment of reporters during the first two weeks of the protests. Protesters have also vandalised buildings and infrastructure. On Tuesday night, a courthouse in Tuluá – a city in the same Valle de Cauca province as Cali – was set ablaze. The government has attempted to cast the protesters as “urban terrorists” and “vandals”. President Iván Duque, whose three years in office have been marked by nationwide protests, has been powerless to quell the unrest, despite ordering the militarisation of major cities weeks ago and pulling his tax plan. In response to Friday’s violence, he announced that another 7,000 troops would be dispatched to Cali to lift roadblocks. “From tonight begins the maximum deployment of military assistance to the national police in Cali and the province of Valle,” Duque said in a televised message on Friday night. His government had been meeting with protest leaders, though those talks have yet to yield any significant results. However, further militarisation will only widen the gulf between the government and the street, analysts say. Sergio Guzmán, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis, said: “It makes dialogue more difficult and increases mistrust in the government, which appears to be very heavy handed with protesters, but lenient when it comes to identifying or punishing police abuses and lawlessness by armed civilians.

Even given Brook House’s disturbing history, it was the most distressing time at the centre she had known. “With charter flights every week, the likelihood of deportation was ever present, increasing our clients’ mental torment. Fellow detainees all around were self-harming. Brook House was a cauldron of despair.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>They began gathering after midnight at a squat office block near Brook House. By 1.30am, 86 escorts had been briefed.</p> <p>Employed by private firm Mitie Care &amp; Custody, which holds the Home Office contract for removal flights, they were warned that Esparto 11’s detainees were likely to be disruptive.</p> <p>There was “no real lead from managers on the priority of detainee welfare”, noted an observer from HM Inspectorate of Prisons.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Brook House staff began removing detainees from their rooms, a process they call “extraction”. Some wore riot gear. Omar was asleep when four officers roused him at 1.30am on 12 August. “But I have a doctor’s appointment on the 13th,” he told them, handing over a letter they looked at before leaving. As he waited, Omar remembers trembling with fear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"96afca558e9587fc8a635bfd2b582fd0626789e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96afca558e9587fc8a635bfd2b582fd0626789e1/0_0_4334_2935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The home secretary, Priti Patel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The home secretary, Priti Patel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 2am, between eight and 10 guards returned. As they took him away, Omar heard screams reverberating from nearby rooms.</p> <p>Several detainees were “clearly distressed”, confirmed an inspector’s notes. At 3.25am, a young Iranian was brought down in wrist locks and handcuffed. A waist restraint belt was then fitted to him. An interpreter tried to ease his fears that Germany would send him back to Iran, but the sensitive conversation occurred in a rowdy reception area crammed with 22 people. An inspector from HM Inspectorate of Prisons described the scene as “intimidating”.</p> <p>As removals were cancelled at the last-minute, communication occasionally suffered. At 5.15am, a detainee in a T-shirt and boxers was presented for handover with a bloody nose. Described as “calm and polite throughout”, the Kuwaiti’s nose had been injured during extraction while he repeatedly insisted his removal was cancelled, the escorts wrote. When they finally checked, it transpired he had been telling the truth. He was freed from restraints but suffered chest pains “caused by anxiety”, wrote an escort.</p> <p>A senior escort wondered if the force used was too much. “Had this [cancellation] been sorted from the outset, force would not had [sic] been used,” they wrote. An internal inquiry found the use of force in this case was reasonable, necessary and proportionate.</p> <p>Two coaches and nine secure vans were waiting. Omar says he pleaded with an interpreter to find a solicitor.</p> <p>According to Omar, the interpreter urged him to comply. “There was a Sudanese before you who resisted … They almost killed him … You are going to be killed if you do not accept,” Omar alleges he was told. “I was grabbed from both sides and taken. I knew that if I resisted or I did not walk, then I would be forced into it, maybe beaten.”</p> <p>Internal reports describe an incident the interpreter may have been referring to. Escorts’ accounts state that a Sudanese asylum seeker, Jamal*, resisted boarding a coach. An officer placed a handcuff on Jamal, giving “a clear instruction for him to let go, or he would feel pain in his wrist”.</p> <p>The escort added that Jamal then “thrashed his head” and tried to bite them. The officer then used the handcuff to apply pain. Jamal was “forced to his knees”, his arms restrained, and taken to a van. Guidance states that verbal reasoning and de-escalation strategies are used before force, but Jamal speaks little English and it is unclear if interpreters were present or if he understood the escort’s “clear instruction”. Jamal declined to be interviewed for the investigation saying he was too traumatised.</p> <p>Joanne Caffrey, who was a police officer for 24 years and is an expert witness in use of force, said regardless of language barriers, stress causes auditory exclusion. “It’s as though you put your head in a bucket of water and somebody’s shouting commands at you.”</p> <p>Pain-inducing tactics can also be risky. While waiting at Stansted to board Esparto 11, another passenger with a history of self-harm was discovered to have a blade in his mouth.</p> <p>Escorts ordered him to spit it out; he refused. An officer applied the mandibular angle technique, which involves pressing down on a nerve behind the ear. If performed incorrectly, the move can cause paralysis or death, said Caffrey. The detainee also risked swallowing the blade, she said.</p> <p>Reaching the runway, the detainees were summoned by their number. Nazeer was willing to board peacefully, he claims. “But… one person grabbed me from my right arm, the other my left, and somebody was pushing me in the back to get me to climb the stairs. It was humiliating and unnecessary,” he says. Escorts held the arms of all detainees who boarded on foot.</p> <p>Half were in some form of restraint device. Jamal was one of two detainees carried onto Esparto 11. When boarding was complete, the atmosphere was harrowing, says Peter. “They were detained and handcuffed, some were crying,” he said. He didn’t witness other Brook House removals but when he later met them said: “I saw that they were in pain.”</p> <p>Prison inspectorate officials are not routinely present to observe charter flights. Even when they are, they may miss the most distressing events. Esparto 11’s inspector “did not observe” the three incidents that involved applying pain through handcuffs, including the bathroom episode, and “[could not] judge the operational requirement”.</p> <p>Yet the escort’s own written internal reports raise, according to Caffrey, searching questions. Of 25 forms completed to detail six incidents, the same box was ticked to indicate force was required because of “non-compliance”.</p> <p>One stated “all efforts to de-escalate situation were made through verbal reasoning”, without being specific.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/27/home-office-to-resume-evicting-some-asylum-seekers-with-immediate-effect\">Home Office to resume evicting some asylum seekers ‘with immediate effect’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Officers wrote variations on “all force used and witnessed was necessary, reasonable and proportionate” nine separate times.</p> <p>This made the documents seem like a “tick box exercise” to justify premeditated force, added Caffrey. Based on the documents alone it was impossible for her to conclude whether force deployed during Esparto 11 was lawful. “Just because there’s a right to use force doesn’t mean it’s right to keep doing it,” she added.</p> <p>A statement from the Home Office said it takes the health and wellbeing of detainees extremely seriously and undertakes individual risk assessments before all returns. It added: “On occasion, people with no right to be in the UK go to extreme lengths to prevent their removal by attempting to cause physical harm to officers or themselves. In these instances, force will be used sparingly as a last resort for their own and others’ protection.”</p> <p>Burgess described such actions against Esparto 11’s detainees as a violation of their rights that risked fresh trauma. They were treated as a “political football”, she said, and their experience was not unique. “The story of Esparto 11 is a paradigm of the UK’s inhumane asylum system,” she said.</p> <p>Mitie said that it followed strict government guidelines to ensure detainee safety. “All officers are specially trained in line with Home Office procedures on the use of restraint. This includes a focus on de-escalation techniques to ensure force is only applied when absolutely necessary.”</p> <p>Yet Alison Thewliss MP, chair of the parliamentary group on immigration detention, believes the Esparto 11 revelations are so grave Patel “should consider her position in light of these shocking reports”.</p> <p>Thewliss added: “This behaviour is barbaric and has no place in decent society. It denies these people access to legal representation, it disregards their vulnerabilities, and it deems this type of force proportionate in order to remove them.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2040bb708565f93ea36c5817b2d208964036f529\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2040bb708565f93ea36c5817b2d208964036f529/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The controversial Yarl’s Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The controversial Yarl’s Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>Drenched in rain, Omar gestured to the wooden crate and tarpaulin he sleeps on. </p> <p>Months after Esparto 11, Omar was tracked down to a European city he doesn’t wish to be identified because he fears another removal.</p> <p>By rejecting all asylum claims made by people who cross the Channel, Patel wants future arrivals rapidly removed to any country that will accept them.

He was taken to the toilet by an escort working for the Home Office who held the door ajar with his foot and, after several minutes, peered inside to discover the detainee had slashed his wrist with a blade. Pinning the man with his body weight to gain “control”, another officer squeezed into the bathroom and placed a handcuff on the wrist. According to an account written by officers, the handcuff was used to “[give] him pain”, a reference to a restraint technique which involves deliberately inflicting suffering to gain submission. In this case, most likely by twisting the cuff or pushing it into the wrist. Esparto 11 left Stansted on 12 August last year, the first in an unprecedented programme of charters by a Home Office desperate to eject those who had recently arrived by crossing the Channel. Accompanied by scores of escorts, just 14 asylum seekers would be pressed on board the 295-seat aircraft. Bound for Toulouse and Frankfurt, Esparto 11 would dump its detainees thousands of miles from home. It is not known what happened to the man who self-harmed in the toilet. What unfolds on such flights usually remains shrouded in mystery. Yet internal accounts written by Esparto 11’s escorts, seen by the Observer and Liberty Investigates, a journalism unit of the human rights organisation Liberty, along with testimony from detainees and statements from inspectors, offer a rare and disquieting insight into the programme. While boarding the Airbus A330, officers allegedly inflicted force on six asylum seekers, including techniques that intentionally gave pain to two individuals deemed at risk of self-harm or suicide. Witness accounts chronicle alleged threats of violence and suggest safeguarding processes to protect Esparto 11’s passengers fell by the wayside. One detainee who was “not resisting, just reluctant” to board a coach to the aircraft was forced to his knees and subjected to pain. The material reveals other, deeper, issues. It sheds light on how senior Home Office officials authorised a secret – possibly unlawful policy – under cover of Covid-19 to expel vulnerable individuals. Introduced quietly after the March 2020 lockdown, the move meant they could rapidly deport asylum seekers who may have been trafficked and tortured. All the passengers of Esparto 11 subsequently tracked down by Liberty Investigates and the Observer after being deported were from war-torn Sudan and South Sudan and claimed to be survivors of torture or trafficking. The story of Esparto 11 also yields another fundamental question: why is the world’s fifth-richest economy so aggressively targeting a handful of at-risk people who arrived seeking sanctuary? *** Nazeer* could see the fuzzy outline of Kent, but feared he would never reach it. Dangerously overloaded, the small inflatable dinghy was steadily filling with water. When they had left the French coast near Calais early on that June morning, Nazeer remembers how the craft heaved as he and 10 others boarded. When they finally landed in mid-morning, they were swiftly picked up by police. Driven to the Yarl’s Wood an immigration holding facility, Nazeer was fingerprinted, his mobile confiscated and he was then interviewed. Nazeer is from Darfur in western Sudan, where non-Arabs like himself had suffered more than a decade of ethnic cleansing. In Sudan, he had been detainedby the authorities, beaten and then fled. In Libya, he was captured by traffickers. After months of unpaid labour he again escaped. Omar*, another Esparto 11 passenger, is also from Darfur and, like Nazeer, would normally be eligible for refugee status in the UK. But the Home Office, noting both had been fingerprinted in other European countries, chose to deport them back to those states under an EU legal mechanism called the Dublin regulation. The home secretary, Priti Patel, aware that Brexit spelled the end of the convention, was keen to return as many and as quickly as possible. Yet a safeguard should have kept Omar and Nazeer in the UK. The Home Office’s initial asylum screening interview is designed to flag trafficking concerns. If identified and judged credible, their asylum claim may be significantly bolstered. But Omar would slip through this safety net. The Home Office had secretly removed crucial questions linked to trafficking, which it later claimed had been to limit contact due to coronavirus. The Home Office says the individuals in this article were all asked questions designed to identify modern slavery. Yet Omar claims his interview was cut short as he tried to tell them his history. Documents charting Omar’s screening interview indicate it was shortened. Evaluating whether Omar suffered exploitation during his journey, officials wrote “no”. Nazeer and another Esparto 11 passenger – Peter* from South Sudan – also say they were denied an opportunity to fully describe the exploitation they endured. When given details of Omar’s case, Maria Thomas, a solicitor at law firm Duncan Lewis, said it was highly likely his removal was unlawful. “Had the interview not been cut short, he would likely have been identified as a potential victim of trafficking and not removed.” Instead, Omar and the others were arrested in late July, taken to Brook House detention centre and handed directions for their removal. Home Office guidance stipulates they should have seen a solicitor. In early August, many of Esparto 11’s intended passengers were seeking legal help. Ultimately, 19 were granted a reprieve; three with emergency challenges close to the plane’s delayed departure at 7.48am. Nazeer, Omar and Peter were not so fortunate. Nazeer learned his file couldn’t be examined until after the plane had left. A solicitor contacted Omar too late; the day before departure. Peter didn’t even speak to a lawyer. A Legal Aid Agency spokesperson said they were unable to verify anonymous claims but said the number of law firms providing specialist assistance had risen. Nicola Burgess, legal director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, confirms its caseload at the time was overwhelming. “The demand far outstripped our ability to supply.” Regardless, the Home Office remained intent on deporting as many as feasible. From August to December, it ran a concentrated schedule of 19 “Esparto” flights, prompting such distress among detainees that independent monitors wrote to Home Office ministers warning of “unnecessary, severe and continuing impact” equal to inhumane treatment. Meanwhile, Omar, Nazeer and Peter’s time at Brook House was increasingly fraught. Three years after staff were caught “mocking, abusing and assaulting” people there, the mood last summer was dire. Independent observers described an atmosphere of “tension, fear and despair”. Self-harm was a daily occurrence – 44 incidents were recorded in August – with 32 detainees from an average population of 92 placed on constant supervision to prevent further harm. Apparent failures to identify vulnerable asylum seekers were reported by observers from an Independent Monitoring Board (IMB). In mid-August, they noted the waiting time for GP appointments to assess detainees’ torture claims grew to 21 days. Serco, which runs the centre, said the IMB “recognises that detainees are generally treated humanely” and found “generally positive” relationships between staff and residents. But Emma Ginn, director of Medical Justice, said systems to protect the vulnerable were “clearly not working” last August. Even given Brook House’s disturbing history, it was the most distressing time at the centre she had known. “With charter flights every week, the likelihood of deportation was ever present, increasing our clients’ mental torment.

By 1.30am, 86 escorts had been briefed. Employed by private firm Mitie Care &amp; Custody, which holds the Home Office contract for removal flights, they were warned that Esparto 11’s detainees were likely to be disruptive.

As he waited, Omar remembers trembling with fear. At 2am, between eight and 10 guards returned. As they took him away, Omar heard screams reverberating from nearby rooms. Several detainees were “clearly distressed”, confirmed an inspector’s notes. At 3.25am, a young Iranian was brought down in wrist locks and handcuffed. A waist restraint belt was then fitted to him. An interpreter tried to ease his fears that Germany would send him back to Iran, but the sensitive conversation occurred in a rowdy reception area crammed with 22 people. An inspector from HM Inspectorate of Prisons described the scene as “intimidating”. As removals were cancelled at the last-minute, communication occasionally suffered. At 5.15am, a detainee in a T-shirt and boxers was presented for handover with a bloody nose. Described as “calm and polite throughout”, the Kuwaiti’s nose had been injured during extraction while he repeatedly insisted his removal was cancelled, the escorts wrote. When they finally checked, it transpired he had been telling the truth. He was freed from restraints but suffered chest pains “caused by anxiety”, wrote an escort. A senior escort wondered if the force used was too much. “Had this [cancellation] been sorted from the outset, force would not had [sic] been used,” they wrote. An internal inquiry found the use of force in this case was reasonable, necessary and proportionate. Two coaches and nine secure vans were waiting. Omar says he pleaded with an interpreter to find a solicitor. According to Omar, the interpreter urged him to comply. “There was a Sudanese before you who resisted … They almost killed him … You are going to be killed if you do not accept,” Omar alleges he was told. “I was grabbed from both sides and taken. I knew that if I resisted or I did not walk, then I would be forced into it, maybe beaten.” Internal reports describe an incident the interpreter may have been referring to. Escorts’ accounts state that a Sudanese asylum seeker, Jamal*, resisted boarding a coach. An officer placed a handcuff on Jamal, giving “a clear instruction for him to let go, or he would feel pain in his wrist”. The escort added that Jamal then “thrashed his head” and tried to bite them. The officer then used the handcuff to apply pain. Jamal was “forced to his knees”, his arms restrained, and taken to a van. Guidance states that verbal reasoning and de-escalation strategies are used before force, but Jamal speaks little English and it is unclear if interpreters were present or if he understood the escort’s “clear instruction”. Jamal declined to be interviewed for the investigation saying he was too traumatised. Joanne Caffrey, who was a police officer for 24 years and is an expert witness in use of force, said regardless of language barriers, stress causes auditory exclusion. “It’s as though you put your head in a bucket of water and somebody’s shouting commands at you.” Pain-inducing tactics can also be risky. While waiting at Stansted to board Esparto 11, another passenger with a history of self-harm was discovered to have a blade in his mouth. Escorts ordered him to spit it out; he refused. An officer applied the mandibular angle technique, which involves pressing down on a nerve behind the ear. If performed incorrectly, the move can cause paralysis or death, said Caffrey. The detainee also risked swallowing the blade, she said. Reaching the runway, the detainees were summoned by their number. Nazeer was willing to board peacefully, he claims. “But… one person grabbed me from my right arm, the other my left, and somebody was pushing me in the back to get me to climb the stairs. It was humiliating and unnecessary,” he says. Escorts held the arms of all detainees who boarded on foot. Half were in some form of restraint device. Jamal was one of two detainees carried onto Esparto 11. When boarding was complete, the atmosphere was harrowing, says Peter. “They were detained and handcuffed, some were crying,” he said. He didn’t witness other Brook House removals but when he later met them said: “I saw that they were in pain.” Prison inspectorate officials are not routinely present to observe charter flights. Even when they are, they may miss the most distressing events. Esparto 11’s inspector “did not observe” the three incidents that involved applying pain through handcuffs, including the bathroom episode, and “[could not] judge the operational requirement”. Yet the escort’s own written internal reports raise, according to Caffrey, searching questions. Of 25 forms completed to detail six incidents, the same box was ticked to indicate force was required because of “non-compliance”. One stated “all efforts to de-escalate situation were made through verbal reasoning”, without being specific. Officers wrote variations on “all force used and witnessed was necessary, reasonable and proportionate” nine separate times. This made the documents seem like a “tick box exercise” to justify premeditated force, added Caffrey. Based on the documents alone it was impossible for her to conclude whether force deployed during Esparto 11 was lawful. “Just because there’s a right to use force doesn’t mean it’s right to keep doing it,” she added. A statement from the Home Office said it takes the health and wellbeing of detainees extremely seriously and undertakes individual risk assessments before all returns. It added: “On occasion, people with no right to be in the UK go to extreme lengths to prevent their removal by attempting to cause physical harm to officers or themselves. In these instances, force will be used sparingly as a last resort for their own and others’ protection.” Burgess described such actions against Esparto 11’s detainees as a violation of their rights that risked fresh trauma. They were treated as a “political football”, she said, and their experience was not unique. “The story of Esparto 11 is a paradigm of the UK’s inhumane asylum system,” she said. Mitie said that it followed strict government guidelines to ensure detainee safety. “All officers are specially trained in line with Home Office procedures on the use of restraint. This includes a focus on de-escalation techniques to ensure force is only applied when absolutely necessary.” Yet Alison Thewliss MP, chair of the parliamentary group on immigration detention, believes the Esparto 11 revelations are so grave Patel “should consider her position in light of these shocking reports”. Thewliss added: “This behaviour is barbaric and has no place in decent society. It denies these people access to legal representation, it disregards their vulnerabilities, and it deems this type of force proportionate in order to remove them.” *** Drenched in rain, Omar gestured to the wooden crate and tarpaulin he sleeps on. Months after Esparto 11, Omar was tracked down to a European city he doesn’t wish to be identified because he fears another removal. By rejecting all asylum claims made by people who cross the Channel, Patel wants future arrivals rapidly removed to any country that will accept them. This central ambition could make flights like Esparto 11 the norm. Experts brand her plans unworkable, incoherent and cruel. The Home Office is unrepentant. When independent monitors wrote to minister Chris Philp last October warning of “inhumane treatment” of detainees, he responded bullishly. “The UK has a long and proud history of providing protection to those who need it,” wrote Philp, and the government “[stands] by our obligations to safeguard the most vulnerable people fleeing oppression, persecution and tyranny.” When told of this, a note of irritation creeps into Omar’s voice. “I was persecuted and fleeing my country [and] was not offered any protection,” he says, before appearing to well up. “To be allowed to stay somewhere that I can live like a normal human being, to establish a life, to have a family … Is that too much to ask?” * Names have been changed Jessica Purkiss is a journalist who works for Liberty Investigates, Liberty’s editorially independent journalism unit Eleanor Rose is investigations editor at Liberty Investigates, Liberty’s editorially independent journalism unit","charCount":"16888","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/aaron-walawalkar\">Aaron Walawalkar</a>, Jessica Purkiss, Eleanor Rose and <a href=\"profile/marktownsend\">Mark Townsend</a>"},{"headline":"Brentford 2-0 Swansea City: Championship play-off final – as it happened","standfirst":"<p>First-half goals from Ivan Toney and Emiliano secured Brentford’s promotion to the Premier League as they ended their play-off hoodoo</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/29/brentford-promoted-to-premier-league-after-stinging-swansea-championship-play-off-final-report\">Read Ben Fisher’s match report from Wembley Stadium</a> </li></ul>","trailText":"<strong>Minute-by-minute report: </strong>First-half goals from Ivan Toney and Emiliano secured Brentford’s promotion as they ended their play-off hoodoo","byline":"Barry Glendenning","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b655efbf7427a8fadcda59360c681413850cea4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b655efbf7427a8fadcda59360c681413850cea4a/0_126_4452_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brentford players celebrate at the final whistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brentford players celebrate at the final whistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<div id=\"block-60b26e498f088d8c3178d03b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-05-29T16:41:21.231Z\">5.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Championship play-off final report: Brentford 2-0 Swansea City</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ben Fisher</strong> was at Wembley Stadium to see Brentford secure promotion to the top flight of English football for the first time in 74 years.

There is that good focus with the understanding we are facing a Swansea team that has done a fantastic season.<br></p> <p>“We’ve played them twice, both 1-1 draws. Steve Cooper is one of the most talented managers in this country, and his experienced coaching staff, who have just performed and performed even better. It’s going to be unbelievably tight. That experience from last year will help in a way but it is not like we are suddenly 20 per cent better. It might help in the decisive moments.”<br></p> <p>“You saw in the game against Bournemouth how much the fans can help us; they had a massive impact on the result. We need the fans there to cheer us on throughout the game because this game will take twists and turns. We will all be a tiny bit more tense but that is a good thing.

Here’s how he saw the fairytale unfold ... Thomas returns: Asked how his team is fixed for their Preemier League adventure, he doesn’t beat around the bush. “Right now I just want to get so drunk tonight and tomorrow I will worry about the Premier League.” Thomas Frank speaks: “Right now I’m empty,” says Brentford’s manager, upon being asked to describe his emotions in an interview on Sky Sports. “I’m completely empty. It’s been such a long journey. I’ve been here with these fantastic players and staff members and everyone involved in Brentford. Last season I thought we deserved to go up and we didn’t, but that’s football. Then we had the shortest turnaround ever ... Covid ... various ups and downs ...” His interview comes to an abrupt end as he is shanghied by several of his players, who interrupt the interview, lift him in the air and spirit him back to the pitch where he gets the bumps. Ivan Toney speaks: ““I’m in the Premier League with the best bunch of boys I could ever dream of,” says the Brentford striker. “I’m a Premier League striker now and I can’t wait to score goals there. Emiliano speaks: “It’s unreal,” says the scorer of Brentford’s second goal in an interview with Sky Sports. “It’s amazing. I can’t believe it. It’s been a very tough season. Last year’s disappointment was so crazy. We were so low. I never cried so much in my life but for us to be here again in a play-off final and be cool and clever in situations .... it’s unbelievable. It shows that we have very good character. We have an unbelievable squad; we’ve had so many injuries this season and we still managed to play well and to win a lot of games and go all the way.” Brentford’s captain speaks: “It’s unbelievable, I’m so proud,” says the big Swede that is Pontus Jansson in an interview with Sky Sports. “It’s been a hard year but we’re finally there. This year we had a very strong group and we believed in it from day one. “I could go home to Sweden and retire now as this is what I have dreamed of. A lot of people questioned my move here but I saw something in Brentford and I brought things here that I learned from Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds. I brought his ideas here with me.” He goes on to say that he will not be returning home to Sweden to retire just yet and a fewe moments laters is saturated with champagne after hoisting the play-off final trophy surrounded by his team-mates. Match recap: Brentford benefitted from a slow start by Swansea City, who gifted them their opener when Freddie Woodman brought down Bryan Mbeumo to concede a penalty that was scored by Ivan Toney. The Bees doubled their lead on the back of a counter-attack, with midfielder Emilioano slotting home with precision. Swansea grew into the game and were much improved in the second half, but any chance they had of overturning the deficit evaporated when Jay Fulton was shown a straight red card for what looked a bad foul on Mathias Jensen. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeeeep! It’s all over at Wembley, where Brentford have bounced back from last season’s disappointment to return to the top tier for the first time in 74 years. They were deserving winners on the day and the final whistle of referee Chris Kavanagh has prompted scenes of jubilation among Brentford’s players, staff and fans. Congratulations to them and commiserations to their Swansea counterparts. It’s all over at Wembley! At the tenth time of asking, Brentford have finally progressed through play-offs and in doing so earn their place in the top flight for next season. 90+5 min: Cabango rolls the ball wide of the far post from an offside position. The flag goes up. 90+4 min: Swansea get the ball upfield but are unable to muster a goal threat due in no small part to dogged Brentford defending. 90+3 min: Brentford corner. They take it short ... and who can blame them? 90+2 min: Brentford throw on another sub in a bid to waste time. Man of the match Emiliano is replaced by Mads Bidstrup. 90 min: Into the knockings we go but we’ll have a minimum of SIX added minutes. 89 min: Yan Dhanda shoots high over the bar from the edge of the Brentford penalty area as the ball was cleared his way from a Swansea City free-kick. 88 min: The jig looks well and truly up for Swansea City, who did well just to make the play-offs on a fairly small budget. They keep plugging away as full time approaches. 85 min: Manning wins his side a free-kick wide on the left, in line with the left side of the Brentford penalty area. Manning floats the ball straight into the gloves of Raya with a woeful delivery. 84 min: Swansea substitution: Jake Bidwell is replaced by Ryan Manning. 82 min: Toney picks up the ball in space on the right side of the Swans’ penalty area, but has his shot on goal blocked by Jake Bidwell. From the ensuing corner, both Toney and Mbeumo are wrestled to the ground by defenders but neither player is awarded a penalty. 80 min: Ivan Toney chases a long hoof upfield from Mads Roerslav. He hads the legs of Ben Cabango, who manages to head the ball back to Freddie Woodman before Toney can chase him down. 78 min: There’s a break in play as Brentford captain Pontus Jansson receives treatment for an injury that spells the end of his afternoon at the office. He’s replaced by Winston Reid. 76 min: Just 14 minutes to go and it’s looking extremely sweet indeed for Brentford, who are two goals and one man to the good. Not even they can blow this ... can they? 74 min: Brentford double-substitution: Marcus Forss and Saman Ghoddos on for Sergi Canos and Vitaly Janelt. 73 min: Emiliano takes the free-kick, curling the ball up and over the bar. 71 min: Brentford win a throw-in, deep in Swansea City territory. From that, they win a free-kick three or four yards outside the penalty area for a Guehi foul on Ivan Toney. It’s almost straight in front of goal. 70 min: Vitaly Yanelt is booked for deliberately obstructing the progress of Connor Roberts out by the touchline. Free-kick for Swansea, near enough to the corner flag. Brentford clear. What on earth was he thinking? Shocking on first view, but looking at it again perhaps I was a little harsh. The Swansea City midfielder slipped while chasing a loose ball, then went through Mathias Jensen from behind, appearing to stamp on his achilles. Whatever the intent or lack of it, it is definitely a sending-off offence. Swansea are down to 10 men following a shocking challenge from Jay Fulton. 64 min: Swansea City substitution: Yan Dhanda on for Conor Hourihane. 62 min: Mbeumo’s corner fizzes right across the face of goal. The ball breaks to Ethan Pinnock, who was having his shirt vigorously pulled by his marker. He escapes and gets a ashot off regardless but his effort is unwittingly blocked by Pontus Jansson, his own team-mate. Such was its velocity that it flattened the Brentford defender, who needs treatment. 61 min: Brentford win a corner, the ball going out off Jake Bidwell. 60 min: Swansea substitution: Liam Cullen on for Kyle Naughton. 59 min: With his back to goal, Jamal Lowe shoots on the turn from the right edge of the Brentford six-yard box. He fires across the face of goal and wide. 57 min: Mbeumo spins and fires over from 14 yards out for Brentford after receiving a pass from the left wing. 57 min: Swansea City free-kick, wide on the right. Hourihane’s delivery is over-hit and bounces wide of the far post. 53 min: Emiliano goes down after contesting a high ball with Conor Hourihane, who stands over the stricken Brentford goalscorer shouting angrily in his face. Replays confirm Emiliano shipped a blow to the back of the head and he’s fit to carry on after receiving medical treatment. 51 min: Some first half admin: EMiliano Marcondes was booked for something or other in the 22nd minute but I missed it a time of great goalscoring excitement. I mention it now because I won’t be hugely surprised if he gets a second yellow. In fact I will be astonished if both teams finish this game with 11 men on the pitch. 50 min: Jamal Lowe cuts inside from the wing, beats two defenders and sends his shot high and wide. Much better from Swansea but they’re still lacking composure. 48 min: That was a wonderful cross from Roberts, who was given the freedom of the right wing by Sergi Canos, who made no effort whatsoever to close him down. In the penalty arera, Pontus Jansson was stauesque as Andre Ayew beat him to the ball. Awful, awful defending from Brentford. 46 min: So close! Andre Ayew gets between defenders to head wide of the upright after connecting with a Connor Roberts cross from the right touchline. He should have scored!!! 46 min: Brentford kick off, with Swansea City hoping to become the only team to come from two down at half-time to win a Championship play-off final since Bolton Wanderers in 1995. No changes on either side yet. Some half-time reading ... Michael Appleton masterminded Lincoln City’s win over Sunderland in the League One play-off semi-final and should be barracked in the street for that act of heinousness. However, he is a very scary looking man, so do so at your peril. You can find out more about the Imps boss by reading this interview he did with Ben Fisher ahead of tomorrow’s final against his former side Blackpool. Peep! Brentford are on top after the opening 45 minutes, having opened their account with an Ivan Toney penalty, before making Swansea’s job a lot harder with an Emiliano Marcondaes strike to finish a blistering counter-attack. Swansea City are down but far from out – they’ve played reasonably well since going two behind. 45 min: Sergi Canos concedes a very cheap free-kick wide on the right not too far from the corner flag. Hourihane’s ball towards the far post bounces of the back of the leaping Andre Ayew, loops up in the air and bounces out of play off the cross-bar. Brentford keeper David Raya was very indecisive there. 44 min: Swansea press forward with Hourihane on the ball but he can find no way through the massed ranks of Brentford’s defence and ends up passing the ball backwards. 42 min: With so much at stake, this is a surprisingly open play-off final. The second half should be fantastic. 41 min: A kamikaze headed back-pass towards Woodman by Marc Guehi almost puts Mbeuma through on goal. Swansea recover and scramble the ball clear, but only just. 39 min: Oof! An attempted Mbeumo cross from the byline takes a deflection and loops up in the air, looks perilously like it might spin beneath the cross-bar and into the goal but goes out for a corner instead. Nothing comes of it. 38 min: Jay Fulton receives a pass in space outside the Brentford penalty area and tries his luck. His shot is blocked by Ethan Pinnock. 35 min: Following a period of frenetic first-half activity, there’s something of a lull. Swansea City have had more possession since conceding the second goal but have yet to give Brentford’s defence much to think about. 34 min: Another corner for Swansea, of course. Apologies! 33 min: Another corner for Brentford. Raya gathers this one at the far post. 32 min: Connor Roberts takes a long throw-in towards the Brentford penalty area, having been admonished by the refereee for trying to steal a few yards. Ethan Pinnock half-clears the ball but Swansea win a corner. Raya punches the inswinger clear. 30 min: Swansea City win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Brentford goal. Connor Roberts pings the ball into the penalty area, where Toney heads clear again. There’s a touch of the N’Golo Kantes about the Brentford striker - there appears to be two or three of him on the pitch. 28 min: Free-kick for Brentford, wide on the left. Mbeumo sends the ball towards the far post but a Pinnock foul on Ayew allows Swansea to clear their lines. 26 min: Swansea City desperately need to get a foothold in this game or they could be embarrassed. Steve Cooper has just changed his team formation to the 4-3-3 most expected them to line up in from the get-go. They had, until now, been mirroring Brentford’s 3-5-2. 23 min: Let’s go back to Brentford’s second goal. They broke up field at the speed of light after defending a Swans free-kick with Bryan Mbeumo on the ball. He played the pass to Mads Roerslev in the penalty area and the Dane picked out Emiliano up in support at the back post. Using a combination of precision and power, he fired inside the upright, giving Woodman little or no chance. 21 min: Swansea are in all sorts of bother. They almost concede a third as Ivan Toney catches the bouncing ball and hits a wonderful side-footed effort from just outside the penalty area off the bar. The ball bounces down on to the line and away from goal. That is a serious let-off for Swansea City. Brentford double their lead! Emiliano smashes home to finish a sensational counter-attack. 19 min: Swansea City free-kick, wide on the right. Connor Roberts swings the ball into the Brentford penalty area, where Ivan Toney heads it clear. 17 min: Advantage Brentford in these early stages, their players seeming to have settled better of the two teams due in no small part to that early goal. Swansea look rattled and have yet to offer anything in the way of a goal threat. 14 min: Swansea City right midfielder Jay Fulton goes in hard on Vitaly Janelt down by the touchline with his studs up, but escapes a booking from referee Chris Kavanagh. 13 min: Brentford free-kick, wide on the left. Pontus Jannsson curls the ball across the face of goal but nobody can get on the end of it. 11 min: Ivan Toney scores his 33rd goal of the season to put the Bees on top. Swansea’s defenders were caught ball-watching as Mbeumo nipped between them to dart on to a perferctly weighted through ball from Canos. Woodman dived at the striker’s feet but didn’t get near the ball and brought him down instead. Toney’s penalty was excellent, beating Woodman despite the goalkeeper guessing the right way and diving at full stretch. IVAN TONEY SCORES! He strokes the ball into the bottom left-hand corner to give Brentford the lead. Freddie Woodman brings down Bryan Mbeumo as the Brentford striker got between defenders to run on to a through ball. 7 min: Now Grimes needlessly pings the ball wide from deep, perhaps pondering his good luck in not getting sent off or his bad luck in being on a card already while playing in central midfield. He’ll have to watch his step. 6 min: Swansea City captain Matt Grimes gets booked for a nasty, reckless challenge on Sergi Canos. I think he’s very lucky not to get sent off for what looked a really wild lunge. 5 min: David Raya hacks the ball out for a Swansea City throw-in under pressure from their high press. 4 min: More Brentford pressurte and Kyle Naughton heads clear a cross from the right intended for Ivan Toney. 2 min: Mads Roerslav tries to steal in behind the Swansea defence and collect a throw-in at the byline. The ball sails out of play for a goal-kick. Now Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman gets his first touch . 2 min: Brentford goalkeeper David Raya gets an early touch, receiving the ball from a throw-in taken by Sergi Canos. 1 min: The ball is rolling in this play-off final with Swansea City doing the honours and despite having no dog in the fight I am a bag of nerves on behalf of all involved. Here’s hoping it’s a good one ... Not long now: The lucky 10,000 fans present erupt as the teams march out on to the Wembley sward led by their managers Steve Cooper and Thomas Frank. There are pensive faces everywhere to be seen on this grand occasion, with kick-off just a few minutes away. First, though ... the national anthems of the UK and Wales. Some pre-match punditry: “I never saw the Brentford I recognised in last year’s final,” says Sky Sports pundit Don Goodman, of the Bees’ defeat at the hands of Fulham last season. “That can’t happen again.” Twelve of today’s Brentford squad were involved in that final and it remains to be seen whether or not the experience will stand to them. Those teams: Thomas Frank names the same team that started the semi-final second leg against Barnsley, leaving Marcus Forss, who scored the late winner, on the bench. There had been talk he might come in for Bryan Mbeumo. Steve Cooper, makes one enforced change, with Connor Roberts replacing Wayne Routledge, who did his knee a serious mischief in their win over Barnsley. Good luck to him in his recovery. Brentford: Raya, Dalsgaard, Jansson, Pinnock, Roerslev, Jensen, Janelt, Canos, Marcondes, Toney, Mbeumo Subs: Daniels, Goode, Norgaard, Forss, Ghoddos, Reid, Fosu, Stevens, Bidstrup Swansea City: Woodman, Naughton, Cabango, Guehi, Bidwell, Fulton, Grimes, Hourihane, Ayew, Roberts, Lowe Subs: Hamer, Bennett, Latibeaudiere, Freeman, Manning, Smith, Dhanda, Whittaker, Cullen Today’s match officials Referee: Chris Kavanagh Assistant Referees: Daniel Cook and Sian Massey-Ellis Fourth Official: David Coote A reminder: there is no VAR in the play-off finals. Thomas Frank speaks ... “We are excited,” said the Brentford manager. “I was thinking about it driving home from training yesterday, that the atmosphere was calm and focused. There is that good focus with the understanding we are facing a Swansea team that has done a fantastic season. “We’ve played them twice, both 1-1 draws. Steve Cooper is one of the most talented managers in this country, and his experienced coaching staff, who have just performed and performed even better. It’s going to be unbelievably tight. That experience from last year will help in a way but it is not like we are suddenly 20 per cent better. It might help in the decisive moments.” “You saw in the game against Bournemouth how much the fans can help us; they had a massive impact on the result. We need the fans there to cheer us on throughout the game because this game will take twists and turns. We will all be a tiny bit more tense but that is a good thing. It is important that we do everything we can to be brave and make sure that we don’t regret anything when we look back. If we perform well, then we can’t do more.” Steve Cooper speaks “We want to get to the Premier League,” said Swansea’s manager. “There are two ways of doing it, either automatically or through the play-offs, and we have managed to give ourselves a chance of getting through the play-offs. It would mean everything. The club has been there before, quite some time before I was here, and that journey was a special one. “Then it was taken away through relegation, and you have to re-establish yourself and rebuild with a different identity. We have got to the last game of this season and given ourselves a 50-50 chance of winning - which is what a final is - and it is something we really have to go for. It would mean everything to the city, it would mean everything to the club and everyone is aware of that. “We talk about it at length, among the players and staff, and it is a massive motivation to get the job done. At the same time, we have to focus on the job at hand and what it takes to get it done; the performance, the mentality and winning the game. I can assure supporters we know exactly what it means, and it is our biggest motivation.” Early team news Long term absentees Shandon Baptiste and Josh Dasilva remain sidelined for Brentford, while left-back Rico Henry has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. The participation of central midfielder Christian Norgaard is in doubt after he pulled up lame in the warm-up ahead of his side’s semi-final second leg win over Bournemouth. Veteran winger Wayne Routledge misses out for Swansea City with a serious knee injury he suffered during their win over Barnsley. Out of contract at the end of June, he may have played his last game for the club. Central defender Brandon Cooper and midfielder Oli Cooper are also out. Very superstitious, but is the writing on the wall for Brentford? They will be wearing their customary home kit of red and white shirts, and black shorts today and will have to break something of a hoodoo if they are to win. No team wearing those colours has won a play-off final in their past 16 attempts to do so. Swansea, by contrast, have not lost while sporting the spearmint ensemble they’ll be trotting out in today. A highly prized place in the Premier League is up for grabs for whoever can prevail in today’s Championship play-off at Wembley. Always the bridesmaids, Brentford have contested nine different play-offs without success and are hoping to make it 10th time lucky as they bid to return to the top flight for the first time since 1947. Their opponents, Swansea City, last played in the top flight in 2017-18 but are slight underdogs today having finished seven points behind Brentford in the Championship table. Both league games contested by the side finished all square at 1-1 so today’s match may come down to a test of who can hold their nerve in a stressful game worth – apologies but we’re obliged to mention it – around £170m to the winners.","charCount":"21019","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/barryglendenning\">Barry Glendenning</a>"},{"headline":"Four arrested at Dover anti-immigration protest","standfirst":"<p>Kent police say about 60 gathered in town centre and along sea front, causing traffic disruption</p>","trailText":"Kent police say about 60 gathered in town centre and along sea front, causing traffic disruption","byline":"Clea Skopeliti","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7ecd82f48ab4aa901af4870e4d8fdfed0759b01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7ecd82f48ab4aa901af4870e4d8fdfed0759b01/211_260_3308_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters at an anti-immigration demonstration in Dover on Saturday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters at an anti-immigration demonstration in Dover on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Police have arrested four people at an anti-immigration protest in the port of Dover.</p> <p>About 60 people gathered in the town centre and along the sea front on Saturday, Kent police said.</p> <p>Two were arrested on suspicion of public order offences and two on suspicion of obstructing the highway, the force said in a statement.</p> <p>The protest, which is understood to have dispersed by about 3.30pm, led to traffic disruption, with lorries forced to line up along the A20 as people blocked the route.

Away he chugged, putting on 19 runs in the first 45 minutes with Luke Wells, but there were occasional boulders as well as bricks, as skimming cover drives and gleaming late cuts were plucked from the level.</p> <p><strong>Yorkshire</strong> plugged away, throwing on Dom Bess, his baggy trousers and shaggy hair a sharp contrast to Jennings’ ironed creases and buttoned cuffs. Yorkshire eventually got their hands on the new ball they had been after all day, and it tookonly five overs to make a breakthrough as Jennings was caught at first slip after a partnership of 175 with Wells. One became three as Wells, then Livingstone followed. But on Lancashire went. For a while it seemed they would try for maximum batting bonus points as Dane Vilas straight drove Steven Patterson for four, then dropped to one knee and pulled him behind square, and Bess was biffed for straight sixes, with Josh Bohannon reaching the scorers’ box high in the media centre. But sense soon prevailed and the grind, grind, grind returned.</p> <p>A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued <strong>Essex</strong> from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. <strong>Durham </strong>were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn’t even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball.</p> <p>Saif Zaib’s 64 helped <strong>Northants</strong> to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched <strong>Sussex </strong>ahead.</p> <p>Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on <strong>Leicestershire</strong>’s first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for <strong>Middlesex</strong>.</p> <p>Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and <strong>Surrey </strong>473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play.</p> <p>A last wicket can-can of 52 for <strong>Warwickshire</strong> between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to <strong>Nottinghamshire </strong>on a day interrupted by showers.

Parky does his trick. Third ball from the Brian Statham end, Lyth guides the ball off his hip straight into the hands of the flexible Luke Wells. The first Oh Lanky-Lanky trills across Old Trafford. Yorkshire 72-1. And another one down: Jack Burnham sticks his leg in front of Peter Siddle’s wobbler (the 19th lbw of the match) and the umpire raises a finger. Durham 155-5, the 230 required for a win gurgling down the plughole. Parky comes on at the Brian Statham End with the crowd in a stupor: time for me to write the round-up! Oh, and Warwickshire are subsiding, three wickets tumbling for 21, Chappell picking up three. At 116-4, they need to chivvy up another 100 or so runs - the current lead over Warwicks 160. Lancashire think they’ve got Lyth on 27, but the ball sprung off the pad. Gloucestershire have lost a third at The Oval, Lace for a duck. Northants are keeping their head against Sussex, though they have lost the run-chase King Vasconcelos for 38. Currently 86-2 needing another 133 to win. At The Riverside, Sam Cook has just collected another lbw - Miichael Jones for 35 - and Durham’s slipper starts to slide. 137-4, need another 248 to win. Leicestershire, set an impossible task by Middlesex, have lost Azad for 1 - 366 or a day and a bit’s batting needed. And from the Brian Statham End, Liam Livingstone just turned one square. Gloucestershire lose two wickets in six balls, a cursed breakthrough by Surrey in their second dig, Brathwaite caught and bowled by Jamie Overton for 28; Dent LBW to Abbott for 14. And Hammond finds himself back at the crease again. And at OT, Parky has taken his rightful place at the James Anderson End, a hanky hanging out of his waistband. There have been four singles in the last 91 balls.... Fantastic generosity from Lancashire, the scoreboard has given Yorkshire six points. Sun out, short shadows, Lyth 16, KC 15. “Hi Tanya. “Hello Richard Hirst “The teatime scores show close to symmetry between the Oval and Old Trafford. As a Surrey supporter from Yorkshire stock (and therefore anti-Yorkshire for cricket purposes) I’m delighted by both scores.” I wonder if symmetry in numbers appeals to everyone in the same way as symmetry in the face? Yes, the scoreboard is working at Old Trafford, its just that Yorkshire have retreated into their spiky shells. Vilas has reverted to pace with Lamb and Wood and Lyth and Kohler-Cadmore defend. Fatly pleased to see Dillon Pennington’s 4-44 in Derbyshire’s first-innings, followed by the first wicket of Derbys’s second innings. Have been waiting for him to have a breakthrough match ever since watching him against Surrey at New Road in September 2018. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 126-3 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Durham need 259 to win Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out and 95-1 v Nottinghamshire 297 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 270 and 16-1 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 204-8 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 158 and 28-0 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 509-9dec v Yorkshire 159 and 28-0. Hove: Sussex 175 and 298 v Northants 256 and 35-1 Northants need 183 to win Ah. Vilas has plumped for a bit of Livingstone for the last over before tea. Will it be the spin twins twirling and gurning throughout the final session? Lyth and Kohler-Cadmore have negotiated this first part of their second innings with aplomb. Yorkshire 28-0, Lyth 15; KC 12. Tea scores to follow. Derby following on at Worcester; Gloucestershire following on at The Oval. And Northants need another 194 to win at Hove, they’ve already lost Ben Curran for 10. Poor Curran, averaging 14 this season in his seven games. Not a bad record. By the way, Parky is on. Middlesex suffering a scuttle of wickets, losing three for five, including Handscomb for 36. Chris Wright 5-43. And Gloucestershire too are in deep trouble. Daniel Moriarty 5-56; Amar Virdi 3-46. Gloucestershire 158-9, no, make that 158 all out. Miles Hammond last man out for 77. They must gear up again, following-on, 315 behind. Durham lose a third wicket - 104-3 - a much better effort than the first innings, but too many wickets gone, too early in the day. The bowler, ten Doeschate, the batsman Lees. 281 more needed to win. Oh, Ben Brown! Sussex now 298-9, with him 95 not out - NO - make that 95 OUT! Sussex 298, five wickets for Simon Kerrigan (horray!). Northants need 217 to win. Would it be rude to suggest that laid-back Yorkshire look in no trouble at all? A fantastic rear-guard display by Sussex led by a century from Tom Haines and a nearly-ton from Ben Brown, who is 95 not out. Sussex 298-8, a lead of 216. Saqib Mahmood does a series of bouncy tuck jumps at the top of his long, long, run. That’s just showing off. OOoof, Lyth cuts, past a diving Danny Lamb at gully. A slightly risky air to that shot. Tom Bailey stands tall at the top of his run, quick and smooth. After one over, Yorkshire are 1-0 and everything suddenly has urgency and energy. This is the fourth time Lancashire have passed 500 in Roses matches and, remarkably, their second 509-9 declared . The first, I know you’ll want to know, came in 1926. 47 overs of the day left. Mahmood is run out for 0 and Lancs declare. A lovely gesture by Patterson, who shakes Bohannon’s hand and then signals to his players to let Bohannon walk back first, 127 not out, and they all clap him off. The groundsman drapes the crease in a black cloth, a funereal spectre of things to come. They’re back on at Edgbaston, Warwickshire pocketing a 44-run first-innings lead. And they’re stepping on it, at OT. Declaration not far away. Tom Bailey slams Hill into the empty seats of the party stand... oh, ... and he’s been bowled trying to whallop a repeat shot. Lancashire 506-8 Dom Bess gets a consolation wicket, Lamb for 61, but the Lancashire declaration doesn’t come. We’re not sure what they’re waiting for - 500? Another Chester-le-Street lbw - this time Scott Borthwick to Sam Cook for 29. Durham 53-2 and the pitch misbehaving. Notts all out at Edgbaston, but they’ve done well to pull themselves to within 44 of Warwickshire’s first innings. . Derbyshire have lost Hudson-Prentice for 25, Critchley hanging on for 61. Hammond still there at The Oval, on 61, but Gloucestershire are in rather a hole, now 129-7, 343 behind. And that’s the hundred! A first Roses hundred, the second first-class ton of his career, off 260 balls, ten fours and a six. He punches the air, whips off his helmet and raises his bat to his whooping teammates and, round the ground, to the clapping crowd. A cracking innings, slow, quick, quick, slow, which has taken Lancashire to an utterly dominant position. Nervous 99s for Bohannon.... And a great preview of the New Zealand series, which starts on Wednesday! No jacket required at lunch at Old Trafford. On my turn of the ground I saw a couple of 99’s gingerly making their way back to their seats, a man in an MCC blazer and matching face mask, and a good handful of children. Here are the Grahams, enjoying a family outing at OT for the first time post lockdown (though Peter has been here every day the match). Happy Birthday for Monday Kian and Zavi! Seat banging and mucho applause as Danny Lamb reaches his fifty with a single off Danny Brook. Off a 142 balls in a vital seventh-wicket partnership as Yorkshire just wait for the trials ahead. An email pops up from Andrew Benton: “Every time I see your name I connect in my head to a film called Ptang Yang Kipperbang, which was on Channel 4 soon after it started broadcasting (40-odd years ago now). I saw it then, as a lad, then forgot about it. Finally I checked it out and am reminded it’s about cricket (!) and more, with John Arlott providing a commentary on the adolescent protagonists life. Perhaps recommended viewing for non-match days (or the Hundred, if that flops!)“ Thank you Andrew! A lovely interview by Kevin Howells with Vic Marks on the radio now. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out and 47-1 v Essex 182 all out and 301 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 274-8 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 193-5 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 125-4 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 113-6 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 439-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 241-7 v Northants 256 all out And that is lunch, as a weary Yorkshire dawdle off the field. The Lancashire lead, 280. Scores to follow. Emma Lamb has reached her hundred, 107 not out, against Western Storm; Peter Handsomb and John Simpson at the crease for Middlesex, who have lost three this morning, but have a healthy padding of 284 over Leicestershire With an over to go, Bohannon needs another eight for his century, Danny Lamb ten for his fifty. Lancs 439-6. A third wicket to Simon Kerrigan at Hove- Tom Haines out for a marvellous 103. And Gloucestershire in deep trouble at The Oval! Brathwaited 38, Hammond 44 not out, but a sorry tale otherwise of noughts and ones as the spinners weave their web : three for Virdi, two for Moriarty. Hammond not out 44 and Tattersall, on loan from Yorkshire, one. And, according to the commentators, the pitch isn’t even spinning yet. If anyone is interested, these were the thoughts of Steven Patterson yesterday. Incidentally, we think that if Derbyshire make 200, Yorkshire will have the lowest number of batting points in the country. “It was an horrendous start for us (with the bat). But fair play to them, they’ve played good cricket throughout and have not let us back in the game. We now find ourselves right up against it. “I thought Keaton Jennings and Luke Wells showed us, in a sense, how to bat on a good surface. When you get the opportunity, make it count. “They didn’t score at a particularly quick rate at any stage, but they made it hard work for us and ground us down. “I can’t question the lads character and effort today. It’s a good surface and hard to get wickets on. “To go at two and a half an over for the first 120 overs is a good effort and a testament to the bowlers skills. But, at the end of the day, we can’t keep expecting the bowlers to pull us out of trouble.” Happy to see Barnard and Pennington in the wickets at New Road - Derby in a bit of pickle at 148-5. Not to worry Yorkshire, but Dom Bess is just starting to find a bit of a twist on the pitch. Notts continuing to bleed wickets, now 237-7, but Sussex are on a roll. Tom Haines 94 not out, Ben Brown 54 not out. A partnership of 96 which has given Sussex a sniff of a chance of fighting for a place in Division One. Their lead over Northants, 114. Thanks to Romeo for pointing out that I’d filed some absolute gibberish about live streams (he was a lot more polite!). I’ll try again: Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits via facebook and youtube, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. Durham, I’m afraid to report, have lost their first wicket on their quest to make large number of runs to win. Cameron Bancroft bowled by Jamie Porter for four. Durham 9-1. Tim Bresnan pockets Joe Clarke for 61 as Nottinghamshire reach 218-5. Danny Lamb (23 not out) is not the only member of his family batting today, his sister Emma is 55 not out for Thunder against Western Storm. Essex’s innings has disintegrated with a familiar flow: another bowled and another lbw, both to Ben Raine, who finishes with 5-64. Durham need 385 to win, with five and a half sessions to get them. Aha. Some amazing live stream data: on day one of the Roses match, Lancashire picked up 159,000 hits, and 153,000 on day two. This is compared with an average of 150,000 over a four day match. Plus more watching on Sky. The Roses, it seems, still captures the imagination. And a gorgeous straight drive from Bohannon off Olivier, pushes Lancashire towards 400. Bohannon’s fifty came at last - 149 balls, seven fours, 1 six - he’s a real block or biff it boy. And I should probably mention, for those of you not watching the live streams, that the players are still taking regular sanitisation breaks. Notts have just lost their first wicket,Lyndon James for four, and Joe Clarke has passed his fourth fifty of the season. Notts 202-4. Here, we’re still waiting for Josh Bohannon to get the two runs to reach his fifty. Voices in the press box saying: “Bohannon for England!” A slow start here, a bit of prodding and poking with a fair scattering of members on an almost humid day. Some cracking reads in the paper today: and one that I KNOW will appeal to County Blog readers: Good morning! It’s the last Saturday in May and county cricket is in bloom everywhere. Some tight games today, results could flourish at Hove and Chester-le-Street ,while Lancashire, Surrey and Middlesex will tighten the screw. Keep an eye too on the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, which starts today. This year, its second, consists of eight-teams (Central Sparks, South East Stars, Northern Diamonds, Western Storm, Sunrisers , Thunder, Southern Vipers and Loughborough Lightening) playing in a 50-over competition. Lastly, apologies for the slight delay to the blog - the dog rolled in something disgusting. Group One Riverside: Durham 99 all out v Essex 182 all out and 263-8 Edgbaston: Warwickshire 341 all out v Nottinghamshire 173-3 New Road: Worcestershire 421 all out v Derbyshire 91-3 Group Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 136 v Middlesex 295 and 57-1 The Oval: Surrey 473 all out v Gloucestershire 45-1 Group Three Old Trafford: Lancashire 350-6 v Yorkshire 159 all out Hove: Sussex 175 all out and 142-4 v Northants 256 all out On a traditionally overcast Roses Friday, the day meandered towards a crushing Lancashire lead. Keaton Jennings was the master builder, crafting his first red-ball century since he made 146 not out for England against Sri Lanka in November 2018. After a couple of years in the wilderness, this season he has rediscovered both touch and brio.

A sixth wicket stand of 125 between Ryan ten Doeschate (55) and Adam Wheater (81) rescued Essex from an unbecoming 53 for five to finish the day with a towering lead at Chester-le-Street. Durham were earlier bowled out for 99; such was the haste of their demise that Simon Harmer didn’t even get to wrap his bowling fingers around the ball. Saif Zaib’s 64 helped Northants to a handy first-innings lead at Hove. After a post-tea wobble, Tom Haines and Ben Brown inched Sussex ahead. Lewis Hill and Callum Parkinson were the only players to make their mark on Leicestershire’s first innings of 136. Martin Andersson was too much for their middle order, picking up four for 27, his best figures for Middlesex. Hashim Amla continued to scatter his munificence at The Oval, finishing with 173, and Surrey 473, thanks to a bit of hurry-up from Rikki Clarke and Sean Abbott. Gloucestershire must now bat out two days on a turning pitch, with Amar Virdi already in the wickets shortly before rain stopped play. A last wicket can-can of 52 for Warwickshire between Liam Norwell and Oliver Hannon-Dalby proved a morning irritation to Nottinghamshire on a day interrupted by showers. Norwell, who had frying-panned three sixes, then nipped in to remove England-bound Haseeb Hameed for 39, Ben Duckett and, later, Ben Slater for 77. Ed Barnard coaxed the tail into a morning wag with another handy innings, this time of 90, as Worcestershire reached 421. On a rain-interrupted afternoon, Derbyshire lost three wickets.","charCount":"16649","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tanyaaldred\">Tanya Aldred</a> at Old Trafford"},{"headline":"Johan Rockström: ‘We need bankers as well as activists… we have 10 years to cut emissions by half’ ","standfirst":"<p>The eminent Earth scientist argues that we cannot just wait for the world order to change when it comes to tackling the climate crisis – we all have a duty to act now</p>","trailText":"The eminent Earth scientist argues that we cannot just wait for the world order to change when it comes to tackling the climate crisis – we all have a duty to act now","byline":"Jonathan Watts","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"590ee043e470fc9ccec3f084fcdb4db4f2de8bef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590ee043e470fc9ccec3f084fcdb4db4f2de8bef/472_599_4252_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johan Rockström\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johan Rockström: ‘The biggest unknown is how the oceans will behave.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hunt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Johan Rockström is one of the world’s most influential Earth scientists. As director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, he advises governments, corporations and activists, including his Swedish compatriot, Greta Thunberg, about the latest research on the climate and biodiversity and argues for better science communication. Last year, he co-edited <em>Standing Up for a Sustainable World</em>, a book that brought together essays from climatologists, economists, environmental defenders, financiers and school strike activists. In recent months, he has teamed up with David Attenborough to create a <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81336476\">new Netflix series</a>, <em>Breaking </em><em>Boundaries: The Science of Our </em><em>Planet</em>, participated in President Joe Biden’s climate summit and co-organised a declaration by more than 100 Nobel laureates.</p> <p><strong>The Nobel </strong><strong>prize summit</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in April</strong><strong> declared a planetary emergency. Why now? Scientists have known for at least three decades that human activity is destabilising the climate and accelerating the collapse of ecosystems.<br></strong>This statement, signed by 126 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/21/101-nobel-laureates-call-for-global-fossil-fuel-non-proliferation-treaty\">Nobel laureates</a>, is a world record. Never before have we seen such a global uprising of Nobel prize winners. They issued an emergency call from science to humanity, calling for reason, truth and humanism in the transformation towards an equitable and prosperous future in a safe operating space.</p> <p>An emergency is calculated by risk divided by time. Risk is probability multiplied by impact. Scientifically, we now have a very unfortunate set of data in front of us. We know that the likely impact on humans of climate disruption, mass extinction and air pollution is very, very high indeed. The probability is also uncomfortably high. This adds up to a very high risk. Now divide that by time. We have unequivocal evidence that we have entered a decisive decade. If we have any chance to prevent the loss of more than a million species, we must halt biodiversity loss now, not in 20 or 30 years. If we want to have any chance of keeping global warming to 1.5C, we need to cut emissions by half over the next nine years. That is what the Nobel laureates and other scientists are speaking out about. This isn’t just a matter of raising the volume on the same old data - it is a new juncture. We are running out of time.</p> <p><strong>In 2018, you co-authored the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/06/domino-effect-of-climate-events-could-push-earth-into-a-hothouse-state\">Hothouse Earth</a> </strong><strong>discussion paper, which warned that our planet could start drifting towards an uninhabitable state if warming exceeds the Paris Agreement target of 2 Celsius.</strong><strong>. In the three years since, have you seen any evidence for this?<br></strong>My hypothesis still stands, though we have since seen new research that both strengthens and eases concerns. On the negative side, we have passed three important tipping points: Arctic summer ice, tropical coral reef systems and parts of the west Antarctic have, as far as the latest science shows, reached the point of no return.</p> <p>We are also seeing more evidence of a weakening of the <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/oceans/amoc\">Atlantic meridional overturning circulation</a> (AMOC) an effect of ice melt from Greenland and the Arctic that reduces the salinity and temperature gradient between warmer salty water flowing north from the equator and colder less salty water in the north atlantic, which in turn slows ocean and atmospheric currents, with impacts on regional climate systems such as the Amazon monsoon. Slower flow of warm waters from south to north, can also explain why the southern ocean is warming so fast, which in turn has led to accelerated melting of the west Antarctic ice sheets. These cascades are a core feature of a potential drift to a hothouse Earth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People feel they have to choose between wealth and protecting the planet. That is an obsolete way of communicating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We will see further support for our hypothesis in the forthcoming IPCC 6 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) assessment, which for the first time will show a change in the climate sensitivity range (the amount of warming projected by computer models if humanity doubles the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere). In the five previous assessments, the IPCC estimated this range would be between 1.5C and 4.5C. In the sixth assessment that will be compacted. The higher point of 4.5C will remain, while the lower point will climb to 2.3C. This means we no longer have a range that goes from a manageable 1.5C to disastrous over 4C. Now the range is from very dangerous (above 2C, which can lead to a hothouse Earth) to catastrophic (over 4C). If we continue as we are, we are very unlikely to remain under 2C in 30 or 40 years.</p> <p>The third piece of negative new research comes from the new climate model at the Potsdam Institute, which is the first to reproduce the temperature and ice on Earth over the past 3m years. Remarkably, this study shows that during this period, the world has not once passed 2C of warming – the hothouse Earth threshold that we postulated. It was not because of a gentle sun that the Earth remained in that temperature corridor, it was because of regulating feedbacks in the Earth system, such as ocean carbon uptake, terrestrial sinks, the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08467-z#:~:text=Introduction,snow%20and%20ice%20area1.\">albedo effect of the icecaps</a>, and so on. We want this new model to examine whether 2C of human-forced warming will push the Earth into a runaway hothouse state or whether it can land back into an equilibrium state similar to that of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/27/climate-crisis-world-now-at-its-hottest-for-12000-years\">Holocene period</a>.</p> <p><strong>How about evidence to the contrary? Are there studies that suggest we can avoid a </strong><strong>hothouse state?<br></strong>On the more positive side, the biggest unknown is how the oceans will behave. What we see in several of the model inter-comparisons coordinated by the <a href=\"https://www.wcrp-climate.org/\">World Climate Research programme</a> is that if we completely halt all greenhouse gas emissions, then the ocean will mop up the damage done to the climate system. That is under the assumption that ocean currents continue operating as now and that there are no further nasty surprises. It would come with very negative secondary effects: long-term ocean acidification, damage to marine life and perturbations of the heat conveyor belt in the ocean. Despite that, overall, I must admit I find it reassuring that the ocean might be able to continue buffering and ultimately clean up. But we urgently need more research on whether or not our planet can keep up its resilience and dampen warming or start self-amplifying warming.</p> <p>The second positive is that there is evidence that it is never worth giving up. Regardless of whether we can phase out fossil fuels fast enough to stay within a 1.5C increase, there is a benefit to doing everything we can. Even after a period of overshoot, of challenging decades of air pollutants and climate extremes, if we can completely phase out greenhouse emissions and go to zero carbon in an absolute sense, then we still have a chance to return within a Holocene-like state.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tree-huggers and frontier activists are very important but they can’t tip this whole thing over by themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You have argued for a new approach in science communication to convey more urgency and agency. </strong><strong>In </strong><em><strong>Standing Up for a Sustainable World</strong></em><strong>, you urge </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>more positive message of prosperity and fairness that can attract an otherwise indifferent majority. How can this be achieved?<br></strong>After 50 years of trying to communicate risks, there is a rapidly rising recognition among environmental and Earth system scientists that we need to back off from an approach of just raising awareness and encouraging a willingness to pay. Indirectly, this creates a trade-off. People feel they have to choose between immediate wealth and protecting the planet. That is an obsolete and incorrect way of communicating. The indifferent majority will only come with us if the sustainable route is not just more attractive but easier. The moment we succeed is when people are sustainable without knowing it; they simply choose the right tomatoes because they taste better and they are cheaper.</p> <p><strong>The counterargument is that more strident activism and a wider sense of alarm are getting the scientific message out more effectively than science has managed by itself. </strong><strong>Talk of prosperity and equality is nice, but isn’t this more effective when reinforced by a fear of the likely consequences if we don’t change? Isn’t it necessary to see the abyss in order to step back so that fear is not paralysing but motivating?</strong><strong><br></strong>Yes, I’m on your side here.

How important is this?<br></strong>David Attenborough is a prime example of what we need to see more widely in society. We need to see people in all walks of life, particularly those who are widely respected such as sports stars and musicians, to come out and say enough is enough. Attenborough has been the most important voice for nature in the world for two generations. Over the past five years, he has moved very drastically from love for nature to the need for planetary stability. This journey has taken him to a much stronger engagement with climate. He is an authoritative and trustworthy source for so many indifferent people. That really helps him get the message across. When he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/21/david-attenborough-tells-davos-the-garden-of-eden-is-no-more\">came to the World Economic Forum</a> in Davos for the first time a few years ago, he basically owned the place. His arrival on stage was the moment that made everyone willing to step onboard. It was remarkable.</p> <p>He also adds an extraordinary capacity to communicate and superb visualisation skills. It is a magic combination. Attenborough’s last film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/25/david-attenborough-a-life-on-our-planet-review-climate-emergency-documentary\">A Life on</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/25/david-attenborough-a-life-on-our-planet-review-climate-emergency-documentary\"> Our Planet</a>,</em> was the best nature documentary ever produced. We explore the science behind it in our new documentary, <em>Breaking Boundaries</em>. It is a very sustainable follow-up because Netflix and Silverback Films allowed us to use the footage that wasn’t included in the original series so we didn’t need to do any new nature shoots.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/greta-thunberg-schoolgirl-climate-change-warrior-some-people-can-let-things-go-i-cant\">Greta Thunberg</a> </strong><strong>is another key ally in this heightened communication effort. How close are you to her and how important is she – and other youth activists – as an interface between science and the public?<br></strong>What Greta has been able to do, along with the whole youth climate movement, including Adélaïde Charlier in Belgium Luisa Neubauer in Germany and Xiye Bastidea in Mexico – is to compel decision-makers around the world really listen to science.</p> <p>In 2018, when Fridays for Future held its first international demonstration in Berlin, I invited Greta to come to the Potsdam Institute to meet our scientists and have a closed-door seminar on the latest climate research. She immediately said yes and I sent an electric car to pick up her and Luisa. Since then, many in the scientific community are informally offering our knowledge to Fridays for Future. They are hungry to learn.</p> <p>I am in relatively frequent contact with Greta. I spoke to her this month. She had a session with the Swedish prime minister about a European green deal follow-up and wanted assessments. These are clever young people. Our exchanges are very informal. I do them because I think they are so fantastic and that they can make a real difference.</p> <p>We in the science community have a responsibility to communicate science. We need to be very active in the science-policy interface, the science-business interface and the science-society interface. Now is the time for science to step up. We should see the youth movement as fantastic proof of the transformation we are seeing right in front of our eyes right now. We scientists should surf along, not behind the backs of youth, but holding hands with them.</p> <p><strong>This informal coalition of science, youth and celebrity seems to be making a difference, at least in terms of public opinion. The leading US climatologist Michael Mann <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/27/climatologist-michael-e-mann-doomism-climate-crisis-interview\">recently told me</a> the prospects for change are better now than at any time he can remember. </strong><strong>Do you share that sentiment?<br></strong>I can’t say this is the most optimistic I have been, but this is certainly a moment. It is like a ketchup bottle. You try and try to get something out and then suddenly a lot splurges out – 2021 is the year when lots come out.</p> <p>The biggest positive development right now is that the three biggest economies in the world – the US, China and the EU are aligning behind the scenes. The US and EU are committed to net zero emissions in 2050, and China by 2060, which is a bit too late but a start. This is due to Biden coming in. It will have a spill-over effect on the global economy. The three biggest economies are saying: “We are now at the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. We are going to cut emissions by half in a decade and reach net zero.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a0a546ade0d3553f1d8e2bfd854e98719c0c4b96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0a546ade0d3553f1d8e2bfd854e98719c0c4b96/0_228_4724_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Johan Rockström, photographed at the Stockholm Resilience Center, part of Stockholm University.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Johan Rockström, photographed at the Stockholm Resilience Center, part of Stockholm University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hunt/Christopher Hunt / The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was another unexpected blob of ketchup with the launch of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/21/leading-finance-firms-sign-up-to-mark-carney-forum-on-low-carbon-investment\">net zero banking alliance</a> during Biden’s climate summit. It has taken a very long time to mobilise financial institutions behind a net zero pathway. Now we quite abruptly got it. This is important. They are the tap in the whole global economy. If you can get private banks, central banks and financial institutions on side, you can cut the flow of fossil fuel investment very fast.</p> <p>I am also encouraged by the race to decarbonise in the global car industry, which is nothing less than remarkable. Here in Germany, I sit on the sustainability advisory boards both for Daimler lorries and Mercedes-Benz cars. A few years ago, a chief executive would never participate in such meetings now he is here frequently because the key discussion in the company is how to accelerate to net zero. That is what we are seeing across industry. Agriculture is lagging behind, but the debate there is becoming more mature. I am not as optimistic as Mann, but we have shifted the narrative and it is much more aligned with what is needed, namely, that the sustainability across different industries, now is understood as the path to profits and business survival.</p> <p>Finally, what makes a person like me most enthusiastic is that we are finally understanding that landing the Paris agreement is not just about eradicating fossil fuels, but about remaining within planetary boundaries. We need to keep carbon sinks in nature intact. We need to take care of the nitrogen, water and phosphorus cycles. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2021\">Cop26</a> in Glasgow should be the first major climate conference where the climate agenda and the nature agenda come together.

There are huge risks of misuse. The only reason why I, the IPCC and most other scientists accept net is there is no choice. There is no plausible chance of an absolute zero landing by 2050. There will be a residual of at least 5 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent a year by 2050, due to methane fluxes, difficult-to-debate sectors, slow transitions in many developing countries and invested assets that cannot be completely stranded. So we need net. The question is how to deal with it. Rule one is that we must follow the carbon law, which means no compromises on cutting emissions of black carbon from fossil fuels by half every decade. That is the pace and that is non-negotiable. Everything under that curve should be offset with investments in nature-based solutions or different forms of offsetting. I argue we should aim for carbon neutrality today, not 2050. Many companies do this, by the way. Walmart tries to do that now.</p> <p>What is disturbing is when a company such as Shell puts out a scenario that it says is compatible with 1.5C and will reach net zero a few years after 2050. At first sight, Shell’s “Sky” scenario looks good, but scratch the surface and you see it is a seductive but completely incorrect analysis. It plans a very slow phase out of emissions, considerable overshoot and then a landing at zero emissions by 2070. It pushes this forward to 2058 by planting trees. That is an example of kicking the can down the road. This is not allowed. We have a responsibility to call out those who use “net” or “magic bullet” technological fixes such as carbon capture and storage and geoengineering to push emission reductions into the future.

As director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, he advises governments, corporations and activists, including his Swedish compatriot, Greta Thunberg, about the latest research on the climate and biodiversity and argues for better science communication. Last year, he co-edited Standing Up for a Sustainable World, a book that brought together essays from climatologists, economists, environmental defenders, financiers and school strike activists. In recent months, he has teamed up with David Attenborough to create a new Netflix series, Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet, participated in President Joe Biden’s climate summit and co-organised a declaration by more than 100 Nobel laureates. The Nobel prize summit in April declared a planetary emergency. Why now? Scientists have known for at least three decades that human activity is destabilising the climate and accelerating the collapse of ecosystems. This statement, signed by 126 Nobel laureates, is a world record. Never before have we seen such a global uprising of Nobel prize winners. They issued an emergency call from science to humanity, calling for reason, truth and humanism in the transformation towards an equitable and prosperous future in a safe operating space. An emergency is calculated by risk divided by time. Risk is probability multiplied by impact. Scientifically, we now have a very unfortunate set of data in front of us. We know that the likely impact on humans of climate disruption, mass extinction and air pollution is very, very high indeed. The probability is also uncomfortably high. This adds up to a very high risk. Now divide that by time. We have unequivocal evidence that we have entered a decisive decade. If we have any chance to prevent the loss of more than a million species, we must halt biodiversity loss now, not in 20 or 30 years. If we want to have any chance of keeping global warming to 1.5C, we need to cut emissions by half over the next nine years. That is what the Nobel laureates and other scientists are speaking out about. This isn’t just a matter of raising the volume on the same old data - it is a new juncture. We are running out of time. In 2018, you co-authored the Hothouse Earth discussion paper, which warned that our planet could start drifting towards an uninhabitable state if warming exceeds the Paris Agreement target of 2 Celsius.. In the three years since, have you seen any evidence for this? My hypothesis still stands, though we have since seen new research that both strengthens and eases concerns. On the negative side, we have passed three important tipping points: Arctic summer ice, tropical coral reef systems and parts of the west Antarctic have, as far as the latest science shows, reached the point of no return. We are also seeing more evidence of a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) an effect of ice melt from Greenland and the Arctic that reduces the salinity and temperature gradient between warmer salty water flowing north from the equator and colder less salty water in the north atlantic, which in turn slows ocean and atmospheric currents, with impacts on regional climate systems such as the Amazon monsoon. Slower flow of warm waters from south to north, can also explain why the southern ocean is warming so fast, which in turn has led to accelerated melting of the west Antarctic ice sheets. These cascades are a core feature of a potential drift to a hothouse Earth. We will see further support for our hypothesis in the forthcoming IPCC 6 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) assessment, which for the first time will show a change in the climate sensitivity range (the amount of warming projected by computer models if humanity doubles the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere). In the five previous assessments, the IPCC estimated this range would be between 1.5C and 4.5C. In the sixth assessment that will be compacted. The higher point of 4.5C will remain, while the lower point will climb to 2.3C. This means we no longer have a range that goes from a manageable 1.5C to disastrous over 4C. Now the range is from very dangerous (above 2C, which can lead to a hothouse Earth) to catastrophic (over 4C). If we continue as we are, we are very unlikely to remain under 2C in 30 or 40 years. The third piece of negative new research comes from the new climate model at the Potsdam Institute, which is the first to reproduce the temperature and ice on Earth over the past 3m years. Remarkably, this study shows that during this period, the world has not once passed 2C of warming – the hothouse Earth threshold that we postulated. It was not because of a gentle sun that the Earth remained in that temperature corridor, it was because of regulating feedbacks in the Earth system, such as ocean carbon uptake, terrestrial sinks, the albedo effect of the icecaps, and so on. We want this new model to examine whether 2C of human-forced warming will push the Earth into a runaway hothouse state or whether it can land back into an equilibrium state similar to that of the Holocene period. How about evidence to the contrary? Are there studies that suggest we can avoid a hothouse state? On the more positive side, the biggest unknown is how the oceans will behave. What we see in several of the model inter-comparisons coordinated by the World Climate Research programme is that if we completely halt all greenhouse gas emissions, then the ocean will mop up the damage done to the climate system. That is under the assumption that ocean currents continue operating as now and that there are no further nasty surprises. It would come with very negative secondary effects: long-term ocean acidification, damage to marine life and perturbations of the heat conveyor belt in the ocean. Despite that, overall, I must admit I find it reassuring that the ocean might be able to continue buffering and ultimately clean up. But we urgently need more research on whether or not our planet can keep up its resilience and dampen warming or start self-amplifying warming. The second positive is that there is evidence that it is never worth giving up. Regardless of whether we can phase out fossil fuels fast enough to stay within a 1.5C increase, there is a benefit to doing everything we can. Even after a period of overshoot, of challenging decades of air pollutants and climate extremes, if we can completely phase out greenhouse emissions and go to zero carbon in an absolute sense, then we still have a chance to return within a Holocene-like state. You have argued for a new approach in science communication to convey more urgency and agency. In Standing Up for a Sustainable World, you urge a more positive message of prosperity and fairness that can attract an otherwise indifferent majority. How can this be achieved? After 50 years of trying to communicate risks, there is a rapidly rising recognition among environmental and Earth system scientists that we need to back off from an approach of just raising awareness and encouraging a willingness to pay. Indirectly, this creates a trade-off. People feel they have to choose between immediate wealth and protecting the planet. That is an obsolete and incorrect way of communicating. The indifferent majority will only come with us if the sustainable route is not just more attractive but easier. The moment we succeed is when people are sustainable without knowing it; they simply choose the right tomatoes because they taste better and they are cheaper. The counterargument is that more strident activism and a wider sense of alarm are getting the scientific message out more effectively than science has managed by itself. Talk of prosperity and equality is nice, but isn’t this more effective when reinforced by a fear of the likely consequences if we don’t change? Isn’t it necessary to see the abyss in order to step back so that fear is not paralysing but motivating? Yes, I’m on your side here. We have a responsibility to communicate the danger, the fear. As scientists, we have long tended to play down the risks. We confused society with sophisticated terms about uncertainty ranges and probability levels. Fridays for Future activists make the threat much clearer. All the cards need to be put on the table. The patient is sick and we must do a transparent diagnosis. We are clearly close to the point that can lead to disaster. A science based fear element is justified and important. Activism is a necessary force for change, but it can be counterproductive if the indifferent majority thinks everything to do with the environment is about barricades, breaking down the world order and an alternative lifestyle – that doesn’t attract the mainstream. We need all forces. Tree-huggers and frontier activists are very important but they can’t tip this whole thing over by themselves. We also need the bankers and executives. Why? Because we have only 10 years to cut emissions by half. We cannot change the economic model in 10 years. We can’t forbid everyone to do things in 10 years. We can’t re-educate whole populations in that time. We have to be very tactical. What is the role of the media and celebrities? David Attenborough is the narrator of your new Netflix series, which explores our understanding of the Earth’s life support system. Compared with a few years ago, he has taken a more strident activist-journalist stance over the planetary crisis. How important is this? David Attenborough is a prime example of what we need to see more widely in society.

It was remarkable. He also adds an extraordinary capacity to communicate and superb visualisation skills. It is a magic combination. Attenborough’s last film, A Life on Our Planet, was the best nature documentary ever produced. We explore the science behind it in our new documentary, Breaking Boundaries. It is a very sustainable follow-up because Netflix and Silverback Films allowed us to use the footage that wasn’t included in the original series so we didn’t need to do any new nature shoots. Greta Thunberg is another key ally in this heightened communication effort. How close are you to her and how important is she – and other youth activists – as an interface between science and the public? What Greta has been able to do, along with the whole youth climate movement, including Adélaïde Charlier in Belgium Luisa Neubauer in Germany and Xiye Bastidea in Mexico – is to compel decision-makers around the world really listen to science.

Can we trust net zero targets? They can serve as an excuse for inaction, as my colleague Damian Carrington and others have pointed out. If we could get rid of the “net” in net zero, I’d be the first to throw it away. There are huge risks of misuse. The only reason why I, the IPCC and most other scientists accept net is there is no choice. There is no plausible chance of an absolute zero landing by 2050. There will be a residual of at least 5 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent a year by 2050, due to methane fluxes, difficult-to-debate sectors, slow transitions in many developing countries and invested assets that cannot be completely stranded. So we need net. The question is how to deal with it.
